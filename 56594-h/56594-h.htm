<h2><a name="PREFACE" id="PREFACE"></a>PREFACE</h2>


<p>There is in England a large and interesting
county, mostly green on maps. We
call it Lincolnshire.</p>

<p>There is a part of that same county where
you see the gleaming silver of the Wash&mdash;so
fatal to King John of unpleasing memory&mdash;and
the green marshlands are drained by wide dykes,
and stakes stand bunched at intervals along the
low-lying shore to break the fury of the sea, at
the great high tides of spring and autumn; and
the river that meanders through the "Deeps," as
these marsh flats are called, has no banks when
the tide is full, but seems as though its waters
brimmed, and only kept themselves from slopping
over by an amazing steadiness of hand in
which you are not wise to place implicit trust.</p>

<p>That is "Little Holland."</p>

<p>Where the ground begins to rise a shade, so
that the great mass of dim red buildings seems
to tiptoe in the rolling sea of green, stands the
famous Redlands College; where everyone, from
Miss Conyngham the Head&mdash;are you brave
enough to ask her?&mdash;down to Tiddles the school
baby, will have something to tell about the thrilling
story which acted itself round about Little
Holland during Joey Graham's first term in the
Lower School. And, let me tell you, they are
proud of that story at Redlands. Here it is!
Gabrielle or Noreen would like to tell it, I
know; but you'd better let me.</p>

      <div class="verse">"There was a small kid called Jennie,</div>
      <div class="verse">A millionaire with a penny;</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">But this her disgrace is</div>
      <div class="verse indent2">She blued it on laces,</div>
      <div class="verse">And so all the rest hadn't any!"</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>
</div>

<p>"But Joe <em>isn't</em> Jennie," objected Bingo,
as Gavin chanted the last line of this
lyric in a cheerful jigging sing-song, and a voice
that would have done credit to a cathedral choir.</p>

<p>"And Mums wanted me to get shoe-laces,"
Joey added. "You see, these haven't any tags,
and the ends are all frayed out."</p>

<p>"What's wrong with stiffening up the ends
with Bingo's play-wax?" demanded Gavin the
resourceful. "I never thought that <em>you'd</em> come
to spending the one penny going on silly shoe-laces,
when we have to go to Luckie Jean's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span>
odd-and-end shop, and might have bought bull's-eyes,
or at least pear-drops."</p>

<p>Joey cast a glance down at the very dilapidated
laces securing her shabby shoes. Her indifference
to her own personal appearance was
supreme, but Mums had seemed worried about
those shoe-laces, and it was a point of honour
in the Graham family to protect Mums from all
possible worries. All the same she agreed with
Gavin: it was a waste to be going all the way to
Crumach and Luckie Jean's odd-and-end shop
without so much as a penny to spend among the
five of them&mdash;Gavin, Ronnie, Kirsty, Bingo,
and herself. She considered the question.</p>

<p>"But Joey isn't Jennie!" objected Bingo once
more with determination. Bingo never left a
question till he got an answer; even when Gavin
smacked his head for bothering, which happened
now and then. Father&mdash;the big, cheery father
to whom the five had said their last good-bye
one chilly morning close on two years ago at
Crumach Station&mdash;had called Bingo "the little
bull-pup," because you couldn't make him let
go.</p>

<p>Gavin knew that, and answered the objection.
"Why, you little ass, Joey won't rhyme with anything,
that's all, and Jocelyn's even worse. And
of course anyone can see who's meant, because<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span>
Joey's the only one of us who has so much as a
brass farthing to bless herself with."</p>

<p>"And she's going to spend all her farthings on
boot-laces," observed Bingo sorrowfully, and the
corners of his mouth went down. Bingo was
only six; that was his excuse&mdash;and he was the
only member of the Graham family who had
been known to cry for years. They hadn't got
a tear out of Gavin when he fell off a hayrick
and dislocated his shoulder, and it was put back
by the local bone-setter&mdash;a process which is far
from pleasant when unaccompanied by chloroform.
Joey hastened to avert the tragedy which
might have disgraced the name of Graham if
Bingo were left in suspense too long.</p>

<p>"If you're <em>sure</em> that play-wax will fix up my
lace-ends so that Mums won't worry, we'll use
the penny on anything you like," she said.</p>

<p>Her words produced quite a sensation. Gavin
patted her violently on the back; Kirsty
jumped three times into the air like a young
chamois, with a great display of long, thin,
scratched legs&mdash;no one in those parts ever saw
anything like the way those Graham children
grew!&mdash;and Bingo hugged her ecstatically before
burrowing in the pocket of his tiny knickers
for a small and grubby piece of yellow play-wax.</p>

<p>They all sat down on the high heathery moor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[Pg 4]</a></span>
to mend the laces there and then. "Lots of
time," Gavin pronounced, consulting the gold
hunting-watch which Father had said his eldest
boy was to have if he never came back. "The
postman never gets to Crumach till four, and
it's not three."</p>

<p>"But there may be soldiers come by the south
train," suggested Bingo. "We'll want some
time to see them."</p>

<p>"Heaps of time," declared Gavin, pinching
bits off the lump of play-wax. "Only three
miles from here to Crumach, and we can see the
soldiers after we've done Mums' shopping and
got the post, if we don't before."</p>

<p>Joey looked up from her refractory laces, shaking
her thick fair hair out of her eyes.</p>

<p>"But <em>the</em> letter might have come by the post,
Gav. If it has, Mums will want to know at
once, won't she?"</p>

<p>"'Course. I'd forgotten that letter might
have come," Gavin answered more soberly.
"There, leave that lace to dry hard, old girl, and
you'll have a topping tag. Did the minister expect
it so soon?"</p>

<p>"He said he just thought it might come."</p>

<p>"Will it come if you've failed to get the
scholarship?" Kirsty asked.</p>

<p>Joey considered. "I don't know, but I
shouldn't think they would write to everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>
to tell them that they'd failed. Mr. Craigie
said there were seven hundred and eighty-two
candidates. Just think of all the stamps!"</p>

<p>The family did think, with a gasp. When
they thought at all about money, it was as a
thing which must be kept for boots and bread
and margarine&mdash;never as a thing that you could
squander recklessly on luxuries like stamps.</p>

<p>"No, I shouldn't think there would be a letter
if you've failed," Ronnie agreed sadly. He
had a right to be serious, for he was, after Joey,
the person most immediately concerned with the
all-important letter, which it was remotely possible
that the postman might bring to Crumach
to-day.</p>

<p>The five had always known that Father
thought boys and girls should share alike where
education was concerned. Joey was to have
her chance at a big public school as well as
Gavin and Ronnie, and Kirsty was to follow
when she was old enough, as surely as little
Bingo. But before Gavin had been two years
at the preparatory, from which he was out to
win an Eton or Winchester scholarship, the news
came to the pretty house in Hertfordshire&mdash;a
house which always seemed to strangers so bewilderingly
full of children, dogs and cats&mdash;that
Major Graham had fallen wounded into
the hands of the Huns, during our last retreat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[Pg 6]</a></span>
in the anxious spring of 1918, and had succumbed
to the brutalities of a prison camp in
the land of Kultur. His private means had
been sunk in an Austrian oil-mine, and were
gone beyond recall; he had insured his life, and
Mums was left to bring up five healthy, hungry
children on the insurance money and her pension&mdash;somehow.</p>

<p>Father owned a little square-built stone cottage
in a tiny Highland village, four miles north
of Crumach. Living was comparatively cheap
at Calgarloch, and they had spent the last glorious
leave there all together. Mums and the
family moved north, and in the rent-free cottage
held a council of war to review their resources.
Joey could see that picture now;
Mums, very slight and fragile-looking in her
widow's weeds, and the family sprawling about
her, all long of leg and outgrown as to clothes,
but fiercely in readiness to fight any notion on
Mums' part that she might have managed for
them better.</p>

<p>It was then Mums had explained that however
economically the family lived in Calgarloch
it was only possible that one child could
be kept at school at a time. If&mdash;Mums stopped
herself and substituted "when"&mdash;Gavin won his
scholarship, Joey could go to school. Ronnie
would have to wait until she left; Ronnie was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>
nearly three years younger, so waiting would be
possible. Until Gavin fought his way out into
a public school the rest of the family must be
content with the village school.</p>

<p>"I'll get that scholarship, Mums," Gavin had
promised, growing hot and red; and he had kept
his word. The name of Gavin Graham had
headed the list of Winchester scholars at the end
of last term; and Joey's chance had come.</p>

<p>By that time the four younger Grahams had
grown used to going daily to the little village
school, where the pupils at most numbered fifteen,
and the master taught "the Latin" with a
strong Doric accent and an absolute enthusiastic
love of all learning, which could not help
communicating itself to the boys and girls in his
care. He taught the secular subjects untiringly,
and the minister, Mr. Craigie, poured the
"Shorter Catechism," and much else, into the
children twice a week so sternly, that it was at
first quite a surprise to the Grahams to find him
the best of comrades and friends out of school.</p>

<p>It was during a thrilling expedition to the
loch for fishing&mdash;Shorter Catechism not so much
as mentioned&mdash;that Joey confided in him to the
extent of asking if thirteen and tall for one's
age might stand a chance as a pupil teacher at
"a proper girls' school." "For if I didn't cost
anything, Ronnie could go, and he's over ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span>
now, and would be fearfully old by the time I'm
seventeen," she explained. "I suppose I could
teach the small kids like Kirsty, and I could always
punch their heads if they ragged in class."</p>

<p>Joey never could think why Mr. Craigie
should laugh so helplessly at this suggestion;
but he was very kind all the same, and said that
he would see what he could do. What he did
was to talk things over with the schoolmaster,
and then to write a letter to:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"> <div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">
<div class="verse"><span class="small-caps">Miss Jean Craigie</span>,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Redlands College,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Lincolnshire.</div>
</div></div>

<p>A few days later he called on Mrs. Graham,
accompanied by the schoolmaster, and with the
answer to that letter in his pocket.</p>

<p>Redlands offered a scholarship once in every
four years to be competed for by girls under
fourteen; the scholarship provided four years
free at the great fen-country girls' school, and
forty pounds annually for books and clothes!
He wanted to enter Joey for the scholarship,
though the entrance examination loomed only
six weeks ahead.</p>

<p>"She seldom remembers the Shorter Catechism,
but the child has a brain," he said; "and
what is more important, she has grit. I don't
say that she can win the Redlands Scholarship,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
of which my sister, the mathematical mistress
there, writes full particulars, but I do say that
she might, although the competition will be enormous.
Let her try."</p>

<p>And Mums had thankfully said, "Yes."</p>

<p>Joey worked early and late during those six
weeks, in spite of holiday-time for the rest of her
world. She lived between the manse and the
schoolmaster's, and the two clever men coached
her untiringly. And then the sealed papers
came down (by special permission) to Mr.
Craigie; and for three days Joey, hot, inky, and
anxious, was shut up in the minister's study, answering
the terrible questions the examiners had
set. And then Mr. Craigie packed her sheets
of foolscap off to Redlands, and there was nothing
left to do but to wait. She had been waiting
now for ten long days.</p>

<p>The postman did not come to Calgarloch.
People fetched their letters, when they expected
any, from the little post office at Crumach; but
the Grahams thought that no hardship; a walk
over the corner of the moor, and across the lower
shoulder of the hills that lay between Calgarloch
and Crumach, was always fun, especially if
there were anything to spend in the town. But
to-day the comparative merits of bull's-eyes and
pear-drops seemed unimportant; they were all
thinking of the letter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span></p>

<p>Ronnie dropped behind with Joey when the
shoe-laces were finished with, and the party
ready to go on.</p>

<p>"If you get it, I could go to Christopher's this
term," he said. "You know Christopher told
Mums there was the one vacancy, and he'd keep
it on the chance, because of Gav having done so
well."</p>

<p>"Yes, and if you got a Winchester Scholarship
like Gav has, in three and a half years, Kirsty
would only be twelve just&mdash;heaps of time for
coming on to Redlands," Joey remarked hopefully,
and then, as a wave of doubt swept over
her:</p>

<p>"But I'll never get it&mdash;out of seven hundred
and eighty-two girls. I went some awful howlers,
I know."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps the others did too," suggested Ronnie.</p>

<p>"I'm afraid Mums will mind if I fail," Joey
said. "Of course she'll pretend she doesn't, and
say all she cares about is my trying&mdash;but she
won't take us in with her dearness."</p>

<p>"'Course not; but you'll have to let her think
she does," Ronnie announced, from the depths
of past experience, and then he and Joey were
silent while they plodded round the shoulder of
the hill, and dropped down into Crumach.
Ahead Gavin could be heard gaily discoursing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>
to Kirsty and Bingo on the Homeric exploits
of Winchester "men"; but then it was different
for Gavin. He had won his scholarship.</p>

<p>Either the shoe-laces had taken longer than
the children had expected, or the gold hunting-watch
had not been entirely reliable, for it was
fully four o'clock when they turned at last into
the main street of Crumach. Gavin stopped
and waited for the other two.</p>

<p>"The post'll be in. We'd better go to Luckie
Jean's first, and get Mums' things after."</p>

<p>As a matter of fact one got a good many of
the "things" at Luckie Jean's, though Mums
had a certain odd favouritism for the newly
established grocer at Pettalva, who sent a cart
in twice a week to Crumach and had biscuits
that were really fresh. But the family plumped
to a man for Luckie Jean. True, the fingers
with which she ladled out your provisions were
snuff-stained and not over-well acquainted with
soap and water; but the recesses of her shop
were so dark and mysterious, her goods so various
and unexpected, and, best of all, her
stories were so thrilling that no ordinary shopman
who drove a cart could dream of comparing
with her. The family trooped joyfully
in a body to Luckie Jean's forthwith.</p>

<p>She had the post office, not so much on account
of her competence, as because hers was,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span>
at the time the postal authorities had decided to
open a branch at Crumach, the one and only
shop there. Later, when a polite gentleman
from Pettalva, rendered desperate by complaints
from the English people who came up for the
shooting, suggested politely to Luckie Jean the
advisability of putting the charge into the hands
of a younger woman, he thought himself fortunate
to escape with his eyes still intact in his
head. Luckie Jean, half blind and wholly ignorant
as to all but local names and places, kept
the post office; and English visitors went on adding
to the national revenue by writing unavailing
letters of bitter complaint.</p>

<p>It was this redoubtable old woman who looked
up fiercely over her horn-rimmed spectacles as
the young Grahams trooped in a body into the
odd-and-end shop.</p>

<p>She was bending over the post-bag as it lay
on the counter, sorting the letters and papers
into little heaps, and keeping up a vigorous undercurrent
of grumbling all the time.</p>

<p>"Na! na! You can't come worrying for
sweeties now. Be off, there's douce bairnies.
I'm busy."</p>

<p>"No hurry," said Gavin politely. "We'll
wait."</p>

<p>And he began to wander round the shop, hands
in pockets, attended by his constant adorers,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span>
Kirsty and Bingo. Joey stood staring at the
post-bag and the piles of letters, and Ronnie
stood near her, breathing hard. It was no use
to interrupt Luckie Jean when she was busy
with the post-bag; it would probably mean ignominious
expulsion with boxed ears, for Luckie
Jean in a temper was no respecter of persons.</p>

<p>"Hillo! The 'Englishy' cake full of currants
is gone from the window. You've had it there
these three months&mdash;'member how I brushed the
dead flies off last time we came, and cleaned it
up?" Gavin remarked with interest.</p>

<p>Luckie Jean happened to have just come to
the end of a pile, so did not fall upon him for
interrupting.</p>

<p>"Ou ay. I selled yon to the Englishy gentleman,
with the niminy-piminy voice on him, that's
at the Widow Macintyre's up the street for the
painting," she answered, with a chuckle. "Fine
she'll recognise it, will the widow; she having
tried to pit me off with ane of the bonnets she
wore afore the deleterious trembles took her
man, for payment when yon cake was fair new.
But her lodger he paid a good Englishy price
for it, and I don't take nowt back."</p>

<p>"He'll have to be hungry before he gets
through it," Gavin opined; but Luckie Jean had
gone back to her letters and took no notice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span></p>

<p>"Evelyn Bonham, <em>Esquire</em>," she grumbled;
"what for should it be the Englishy way for to
gi' a manfolk the name of a wumman? And
staying at 'The Neste' near Crumach. I've
heard tel of Nests. Yon must wait till I've
cried on the tinker-body, as should be round in
the tail of the week; that body kens a'body's
business."</p>

<p>"I think 'The Neste' is that jolly little new
house under the hill; we could leave it as we go
back, Luckie, if you liked," ventured Joey.</p>

<p>Luckie Jean looked up at her consideringly.</p>

<p>"You keeps your eyes in your head, bairn.
Maybe I'll trust you wi' it, but a postwoman
must be gey particular, ye ken."</p>

<p>"I know," Joey agreed, in all good faith,
though it was hard to attend to ordinary remarks
like that when one was just trembling
with eagerness to know what letters were for the
house of Graham.</p>

<p>"You'll mebbe like to take a bit of a look at
they scrawly anes as I've pit in the pile ower
yonder?" inquired Luckie Jean, unbending still
more. "There're what they ca's 're-directed,'
but there's not mony writes plain for all their
fine schuling, bairn. They anes 'ull likely need
to wait till my niece comes from Pettalva, as
have the gey expensive spectacles.... Na, laddie,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span>
ye'll not be distairbing the postmistress at
her duties. Bacon&mdash;you canna be needing more&mdash;you
had the half-pound Monday."</p>

<p>The customer, a small bare-footed boy, clasping
a coin tightly in his hand, looked apprehensively
at the postmistress. "But ma mither...."</p>

<p>"Be off, and tell your mither you've ate your
half-pound far too quick," thundered the autocrat;
but Gavin came to the rescue, stifling a
laugh.</p>

<p>"I say, mother, can't <em>I</em> weigh it out for the
youngster? You showed me how, ages ago."</p>

<p>"Ou ay, ye'll still be meddling," growled
Luckie Jean over her post-bag, but she did not
say no, and Gavin served her customer, and put
the money into the till in a very professional
manner.</p>

<p>Joey in the meanwhile got to the pile of
redirected letters, and soon succeeded in sorting
them, the writing in most cases hardly
justifying the severe criticism of the Crumach
postmistress. Then, at last, she ventured the
question she had been burning to put all the
time:</p>

<p>"Have you come on any for us yet?"</p>

<p>Luckie Jean, busied in making a final scoop
all round the bag with her long, thin arm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span>
jerked her head in the direction of a little pile
at the end of the counter.</p>

<p>"There you be&mdash;twa or three letters, and a
newspaper for your maw. That's aal."</p>

<p>Five Grahams hurled themselves simultaneously
on the little pile, while Luckie Jean tied
the rest up in lots according to their destination.
Gavin was there first; he looked and flung them
down, one after another in deep disappointment.</p>

<p>"The blue one&mdash;that'll be from Cousin Greta&mdash;see
the crest! The white one with the small,
screwgy writing&mdash;that's from Uncle Stafford.
<em>That's</em> a bill, and this is a newspaper; nothing
from Redlands, Joey!"</p>

<p>Joey bit back a little gulp of disappointment.</p>

<p>"I didn't really think there would be," she
said. "Can we leave any more letters for you
on our way, Luckie Jean?"</p>

<p>"Ye'll mind not to get playing and forgetting
of them?" asked the careful postmistress, and
as she spoke she put a tied-together packet into
Joey's hand. The string was insecurely fastened,
and the eight or nine letters came to the
floor in a heap&mdash;all except one, the bottom one,
which stayed in Joey's hand. Luckie Jean's
heading had been at fault again, for this letter&mdash;mixed
up with Sir Henry Martyn's, and Miss
Martyn's, and Captain Kingston's&mdash;was directed
quite distinctly to:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>
<div class="poetry-container"> <div class="poetry"> <div class="stanza">

<div class="verse indent2">Pilot Cottage,</div>
<div class="verse indent4">Calgarloch,</div>
<div class="verse indent6">Near Crumach, N.B.</div>
</div></div>

<p>Something seemed to catch at Joey's throat,
so that for a moment speaking was quite difficult.
She always remembered afterwards the
way things looked as she saw them then: the
dusty, low-roofed shop, with its dim recesses,
where brooms and brushes and oil-casks lurked;
the choked windows with articles of food displayed;
the open box of coarse cottons and crochet
wools; the flitches of bacon; the gay tins
of salmon; Gavin behind the counter; Luckie
Jean closing the post-bag. Then Joey swallowed
hard and opened the letter. This is what she
read:</p>

<p>"The Trustees of the Redlands Scholarship
Fund have much pleasure in informing Miss
Jocelyn Graham that she obtained the largest
number of marks in the recent examination, and
the Redlands Scholarship has accordingly been
awarded to her.</p>

<p>"She is therefore entitled to four years' free
residence and tuition at Redlands College, and
an annual grant of forty pounds for necessary
expenses."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[Pg 18]</a></span></p>

<p>"I've ... I've got it!" Joey said.</p>
<hr class="chap" />
</div>


<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="2">II</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">Out into the World</small></h2>

<p>Everything about Joey was new&mdash;from
top to toe, from hat to boots&mdash;particularly
boots. That knowledge was about the
newest thing of all.</p>

<p>She sat in her corner of the third-class compartment,
looking alternately from the window
at the flying scenery of Scotland and then
down at those boots&mdash;strong, unpatched, with
superior unknotted laces, all quite new.</p>

<p>She was wearing the long, dark green uniform
coat of Redlands and the soft, green close-fitting
hat, with a band of the same colour
round the crown and the school arms stamped
in silver. Underneath she wore the dark green
serge "djibbah" with white flannel blouse and
green tie.</p>

<p>These things had come for her from Redlands
a week ago, with the bill, which Mums had
paid out of that amazing cheque for forty
pounds&mdash;a cheque which Joey had been proud
to endorse under the envious eyes of her brothers
and sister.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[Pg 19]</a></span></p>

<p>The cheque carried with it an amazing sense
of wealth, so it had been a blow when Mums
firmly refused to allow one penny of it to be
spent on anything but boots and clothes for
Joey herself. However, Mr. Craigie (after
some careful calculations of which the family
knew nothing) produced ten shillings as a parting
tip on the day the family were going <em>en
masse</em> to Pettalva to choose Joey's boots.</p>

<p>That was a great day for Joey Graham, aged
thirteen years and three months, for Mr.
Craigie's gift was hampered by no restrictions.
She proudly stood lunch to all the rest, <em>and</em>
tipped the waiter&mdash;a seedy gentleman with a
good deal of limp and dingy shirt-front, who was
nevertheless an adept at putting cruets, Worcester
sauce bottles, etc., over the stains on the
tablecloth of the little back-street restaurant
where they partook largely of sausages and
mashed potatoes, limp pastry and ginger-wine,
with Joey hospitably urging them on to further
efforts. Even Gavin the Winchester "man" was
no greater in the eyes of his family that day!</p>

<p>There had been very little time for inconvenient
thoughts of possible home-sickness to
obtrude themselves during those bustling days
of preparation. Of course it would be strange
to have two days' journey between herself and
Mums and the rest, Joey knew; but people who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[Pg 20]</a></span>
have won a scholarship don't go in for being
home-sick. Besides, there would be Miss
Craigie, Mr. Craigie's sister&mdash;mathematical
mistress at Redlands and a ready-made friend,
Joey was comfortably sure.</p>

<p>So she made her own final preparations very
cheerfully, and helped Mums&mdash;rather stickily&mdash;with
the getting ready of Ronnie's shirts and
stockings for his plunge a week later into
Gavin's old preparatory; and said good-bye and
thank you to the schoolmaster and to Effie and
Ailie, the sawmiller's twin girls, who sat next
her in class; and to Luckie Jean, who unbent to
an extraordinary degree and presented a whole
bag of "sweeties" at parting; and was finally
seen off at Crumach by the entire family, with
an old military portmanteau that had been Father's,
and a bewildering quantity of new clothes
in it.</p>

<p>Mums went with her to the junction at Pettalva;
from there she was to travel in the care
of the guard to Edinburgh, where Miss Craigie
would meet her and take her down to Redlands
next day.</p>

<p>Mums and Joey both found a tendency to
leave little gaps in the conversation, as the roofs
of Pettalva began to come in sight.</p>

<p>"I shall try to find someone who is going the
whole way to Edinburgh, darling," Mums said,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span>
after one of those gaps. "Then I shall feel quite
happy about you."</p>

<p>"I'll be all right anyway," Joey said determinedly.</p>

<p>"Yes, my Joey, I know you will; but everything,
including the travelling, will be a little&mdash;new."</p>

<p>"I know Mums. Don't you worry; <em>I</em>
shan't," Joey persisted, though the roofs of Pettalva
were rather blurred just then. "I know
it will be new, but I'm going to like Redlands
awfully, and write you reams of letters, so you
won't be dull&mdash;and&mdash;and"&mdash;Joey swallowed a
lump in her throat&mdash;"there won't be such a heap
of stockings for you to mend, anyhow."</p>

<p>They two were alone in the compartment;
Mums caught Joey in her arms and held on to
her tight. "Oh, my Joey, I <em>like</em> mending the
stockings!" she cried, with a little sob in her
voice, and then she tried to laugh.</p>

<p>"But I am going to love your letters, darling,
and live in the interesting new world with you.
Shan't we watch for the post, Kirsty and Bingo
and I, and always be making excuses to go to
the odd-and-end shop?"</p>

<p>Mums put away her handkerchief, and went
on more in her ordinary voice:</p>

<p>"None of us have ever seen the fen country;
you'll have to tell us all about it. And Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span>
Greta said something about asking you out on a
Sunday, now and then, and she has all kinds of
beautiful things at her house that you will enjoy
seeing."</p>

<p>Joey looked doubtful. Cousin Greta's infrequent
calls at the old home had generally ended
in disgrace for at least one member of the family.
For Cousin Greta made no secret of the fact
that she considered all the children a hopeless
set of little raggamuffins, and somebody was certain
to live down to her ideas. Lady Greta Sturt
was Father's cousin and always spoke of the
children as his only, though she put their faults
down to poor Mums. She brought them the
best chocolates when she came&mdash;such chocolates
as were a rare and unaccustomed luxury even
before the War&mdash;but the Grahams were not to
be bought by chocolates, though it must be owned
that they ate them with great speed and enjoyment.
Joey wasn't sure that to be asked out by
Cousin Greta would add to the joy of Redlands.</p>

<p>"You will be nice to her if she should ask
you," Mums went on, in her soft, pleading voice.
"She was very fond of Father and did a great
many kind things for him when he was little, he
always said."</p>

<p>"She's probably gone off, like Luckie Jean's
Englishy cakes do," Joey said solemnly; but added,
for Mums' comfort:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p>"Don't worry, Mums. I'll be as nice as I
know how, and most likely she won't want me
again after she's seen me once."</p>

<p>Mums smiled, and then the train stopped at
Pettalva Junction, and the bustle of changing
began.</p>

<p>Mums found a lady going all the way to Edinburgh&mdash;a
cheerful, capable-looking personage
who breezily undertook to see Joey safely into
the hands of Miss Craigie at the Waverley Station.
Then Mums bought Joey buns and two
apples and a magazine, and reminded her of the
packet of sandwiches in her pocket and kissed
her silently; and Joey said, "Don't mind, Mums;
I'm going to <em>like</em> it."</p>

<p>And then the train slid out of the station and
Joey was off to the new world, and Mums was
left behind.</p>

<p>That was the beginning of the long day's
travelling down through Scotland, and now she
was almost at Edinburgh, and the end. In a
few minutes Miss Craigie would meet her&mdash;Miss
Craigie, whom Joey saw as a replica of her
brother, only in a coat and skirt&mdash;and she would
be hearing all about Redlands, and learning
what a new girl ought to know. Joey remembered
from school stories that new girls need
a lot of watching if they are not to begin their
school career with unforgivable blunders. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[Pg 24]</a></span>
was very thankful that she was going to travel
with Miss Craigie.</p>

<p>She was also rather thankful that this day's
journey was nearly over. She seemed to have
sat still for such a long, long time. Mrs.
Tresham had broken it a little for herself by
going to the restaurant-car for lunch; but though
she had pressed Joey most kindly to come with
her as her guest, explaining that she hated meals
alone, Joey stuck to it firmly that she preferred
sandwiches, having her own private supply of
family pride. She ate her sandwiches&mdash;potted
shrimp and margarine&mdash;and the buns and the
apples in solitude; they didn't take long&mdash;nothing
like as long as Mrs. Tresham's lunch did.</p>

<p>The afternoon was very long, but tea-time
came at last, and she had been told to have tea
in the restaurant-car. She and Mrs. Tresham
had it together, at a little table, fixed firmly to
the floor; and there was hot, buttered toast and
a sort of mongrel jam, and you had to pour the
tea carefully because of the lurches of the train.
Joey enjoyed that meal, and it was five o'clock
by the time it was finished, and she and Mrs.
Tresham had reeled back along the swaying corridor
to their own compartment; and at six they
were due at Edinburgh.</p>

<p>Joey tidied herself up and washed her hands
even before the Forth Bridge was reached; she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>
was so anxious to be ready in good time. And
that wonderful engineering feat was crossed&mdash;with
a certain thrilling and delightful sense of
insecurity about the crossing&mdash;and Corstorphine
Hill was passed, and the train was slipping into
the Waverley Station. Edinburgh at last!</p>

<p>Joey was in the corridor in a second, looking
for Miss Craigie. Of course it was not wonderful
that she did not see her at once; the station
was so big and the people so many. But even
when she had got out, accompanied by the small
suit-case containing her night-things, and by her
new umbrella, and had stood quite a long time
waiting and tiptoeing by the door of the compartment
while Mrs. Tresham claimed the luggage
for them both, still there was no sign of
anyone who looked like Mr. Craigie's sister.</p>

<p>A stout, elderly woman stood at a little distance
among the fast-thinning crowd surveying
her unblinkingly, but Joey was sure that <em>could
not</em> be Miss Craigie. Just as Mrs. Tresham
came back with the luggage and a porter, this
personage moved forward and spoke to Joey
with distinct caution. "I'm thinking you might
be perhaps Miss Jocelyn Graham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I am," Joey confessed, staring.</p>

<p>The stout woman became less cautious, and
more communicative.</p>

<p>"As am own husband's cousin to Maggie<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span>
M'Tulloch, and when she telled me of Miss
Craigie being down, puir body, wi' the influenzy,
and the young leddy not to gang near the hoose
for fear o' carrying the infection to her braw new
schule...."</p>

<p>"Oh, is Miss Craigie ill? I <em>am</em> sorry," Joey
cried out.</p>

<p>"The temperature being one hundred and
four, forbye some points up which I canna mind
exactly, I'm douting she's for the pewmonia,
and twa in the next hoose abune lying deed of
the same," the stout woman mentioned, with a
certain gloomy satisfaction that puzzled Joey.
"And says I to Maggie M'Tulloch, 'I'll take the
young leddy,' says I, 'and what o'wer chances
<em>she'll</em> not tak' the infection awa' wi' her.'"</p>

<p>"Thank you; that's awfully kind," Joey said
politely, though mournfully. She explained to
Mrs. Tresham, who looked somewhat mystified
by the flood of broad Scotch.</p>

<p>"You poor child, I should like to take you
with me to my hotel for to-night, but I suppose
I hardly could, as I am staying with a friend
there. But I don't like this for you. Have you
authority from Miss Craigie?" she asked suddenly,
turning to Maggie M'Tulloch's "own
cousin" as though she rather hoped for a negative
answer.</p>

<p>But there was no escape. Maggie M'Tulloch's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span>
kinswoman dived promptly into a black
knitted bag that she carried and produced a sheet
of paper, scrawled in pencil:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I am so sorry, but I may not see you, Joey.
Mrs. Nicol will take care of you, and put you
into your train to-morrow. Good luck.</p>

<p class="signed">
"<span class="small-caps">Jean Craigie.</span>"<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>There was no help for it. Joey shook hands
with kind Mrs. Tresham and thanked her, and
walked off beside Mrs. Nicol in the wake of a
huge outside porter, who wheeled her trunk on
a barrow. They came up into the width and
glare of Princes Street, crossed it, turned up a
narrower street running at right angles to it,
went half-way down, still following the porter,
and turned into another narrower still, where
narrow "wynds" or thread-like passages showed
between the immensely tall old houses. In this
street Mrs. Nicol stopped at last, produced a
latch-key, and opened the door into a hall made
dimly visible by a glimmer only of gas.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be pleased to mount, miss," she said
unsmilingly.</p>

<p>Joey mounted four flights of stairs, all covered
with slippery linoleum, till she landed at
last in a room which looked as though no one
could ever have laughed in it from the time the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span>
house was built. Four wooden waiting-room
chairs stood against the mustard-coloured walls;
a square table covered with a mottled brown
cloth stood exactly in the centre. A cheap,
crudely coloured print of "The last sleep of
Argyle" above the chimney-piece was the sole
attempt at ornament, unless one counted the dim
cruets which occupied, for the want of a side-board,
the centre of the dingy and once white-painted
mantelpiece. The room was at once cold
and stuffy.</p>

<p>"Ye'll be taking your supper here, miss, and
then ye shall gang to your bed," Mrs. Nicol informed
her, and Joey, seeing nothing whatever
to stay up for, agreed meekly. It was not the
evening she had pictured to herself, but she must
make the best of it. She wrote a pencil post
card to Mums, while Mrs. Nicol laid the table
and set before her a rather gristly chop, in which
she mentioned that the journey had been "all
right" and she herself was "all right" too. It
seemed better not to mention Miss Craigie's illness,
and this rather desolate reception, when she
happened to be one of those five children who
had promised father to "take care of Mums."</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="3">III</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Duties of a Scholarship Kid</small></h2>

<p>"She'll be there, I suppose?"</p>

<p>"Why should she, you mugwump? A
scholarship kid won't have an entrance exam
like an ordinary new girl."</p>

<p>"I wish to goodness the Redlands trustees had
never thought of the old scholarship idea,"
grumbled a third voice. "Mary Hertford was
rather the limit, wasn't she? at least when she
was in the Lower School&mdash;setting the pace so
frightfully fast, specially in maths, but at least
Mary was our own sort. I don't call it playing
the game to shove village schoolgirls among us."</p>

<p>"Syb, you don't mean it?"</p>

<p>"I do. Miss Wakefield told mother. The
Lamb had had a letter from her dear Miss
Craigie, I fancy, and in her joy went bleating
round to everyone.... Fact! This scholarship
kid was the priceless gem from some village
school."</p>

<p>"How putrid!"</p>

<p>"What on earth are we to do with her?"</p>

<p>"Put up with her, I suppose, Noreen, my good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span>
child. What else do you suppose we can do?"</p>

<p>"Wish to goodness I hadn't worked so beastly
hard last term. Reward, Remove II. B, and
the company of this village kid. It's sure to be
in Remove II. with scholarship! Think she'll
say 'sy' for say, and drop her 'h's'?"</p>

<p>"She's Scotch, not Cockney, you cuckoo, and
probably quite harmless," someone else chimed
in. "But I should have thought the Grammar
School a bit more her line. However to Redlands
she's coming, and at Redlands she'll presumably
stay, and we shall have to make the best
of it."</p>

<p>"And of her," groaned the girl called Syb.</p>

<p>There was a silence; for the little group of
girls in the corridor had to make room for some
indignant fellow-passengers to pass out from the
compartment in the corner of which Joey was
wedged, unable, without putting her fingers into
her ears, and so drawing undesired attention to
herself, to help overhearing the chief part of this
conversation. These girls had joined the train at
Lincoln, where Joey, in accordance with instructions,
had changed for the local line; and the
train had been so full that these girls had never
bothered to find a seat at all, but stood in a tight
bunch in the corridor, talking loudly to make
themselves heard above the roar of the train.
They were Redlands girls; Joey would have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[Pg 31]</a></span>
known that by their uniform if she hadn't by
their talk.</p>

<p>It had taken her a minute or two to tell what
they meant by village schoolgirls; when she
did, her face grew hot, and she stared defiantly
towards them.</p>

<p>They were outsiders themselves, thought Joey,
to talk like that about a girl who was coming to
Redlands, even if she had been to a different
sort of school before. But though the thinking
it was certainly a relief, it could not quite do
away with the sore, hurt feeling. Evidently the
Redlands girls were not inclined to start friends.</p>

<p>It was all the harder to bear because they
were such jolly-looking girls. The one called
Noreen was extremely pretty, with lovely Irish-blue
eyes under black eyebrows, and a wealth
of dark hair; and even Syb was nice-looking,
with a bright colour and a straight, determined
figure. The girl who had spoken last was short
and insignificant, with bobbed hair, but her eyes
were very bright and her smile infectious, Joey
settled; while the other two were a round-faced
couple, much too nice in appearance for the sentiments
they had been expressing.</p>

<p>Joey was to have an opportunity for studying
them more closely in a minute, for apparently
they had had enough of standing in the corridor,
and came pouring into her compartment so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>
soon as the other passengers had poured out.
They didn't trouble even to put their hockey
sticks in the rack, by which Joey guessed that
Mote Deep, the station for Redlands, was not
far away.</p>

<p>The one called Syb caught sight of Joey as
they came in. "Hullo!" she said.</p>

<p>"Hullo!" Joey answered, not being sure what
to answer.</p>

<p>"New kid, aren't you?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Noreen.</p>

<p>"Jo&mdash;Jocelyn Graham."</p>

<p>Noreen shot a quick glance at Syb. "Where
do you come from?"</p>

<p>"Scotland." Joey did not feel inclined to be
communicative.</p>

<p>"You're not the scholarship kid, are you, by
any chance?" demanded the girl with the bobbed
hair.</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Oh, murder! I didn't think you were, somehow."</p>

<p>"Did you think I was going to look so awfully
unlike everybody else?" Joey demanded in
her turn. She could not quite keep the hurt
tone out of her voice, though she tried.</p>

<p>"No; why should we?" the girl with the bobbed
hair answered, a shade uncomfortably, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[Pg 33]</a></span>
then they all looked at each other and there was
an awkward little pause. Noreen broke it,
speaking in a more friendly tone than any of
them had done yet.</p>

<p>"I suppose you've had someone to put you up
to what scholarship girls have to do at Redlands?"</p>

<p>"No." Joey was not expansive, suspecting
some covert allusion to that village school, which
appeared so upsetting to these very select Redlanders.</p>

<p>"Oh, didn't they?" Noreen's blue eyes met
hers gravely, and, Joey fancied, sympathetically.</p>

<p>It was rather difficult to ask any favours of
girls who despised her, but Miss Craigie was far
away in Edinburgh, wrestling with the "influenza"&mdash;poor
Miss Craigie!&mdash;and clearly she
was on the edge of one of those pitfalls that lie
in wait for new girls.</p>

<p>"If it wouldn't be a bother, perhaps you would
tell me what I have to do?" she asked.</p>

<p>Noreen leaned forward confidentially. "Of
course I will. There's not much to tell; just two
or three little things that are always done by the
scholarship winner."</p>

<p>The others all displayed a sudden and flattering
interest in Joey. They leaned forward
too, so as not to miss a word.</p>

<p>"Tidying the Lab is the most important<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span>
thing," Noreen went on gravely. "We've got a
jolly old French Stinks Professor, Monsieur
Trouville; frightfully brainy over stinks, but untidy&mdash;oh!
my Sunday hat and Dublin Castle!&mdash;untidy
isn't the word for it!"</p>

<p>Joey tried to grasp the situation valiantly.</p>

<p>"Do I sweep or dust or wash up his messes
or what?" she asked.</p>

<p>The girl with the bobbed hair coughed alarmingly.
Syb thumped her back, and said, "Shut
it, Barbara!"</p>

<p>Noreen seemed a little taken aback by this
question. "No, you don't, I think&mdash;and, anyhow,
you <em>never</em> empty messes out of one saucer
into another or you'd probably blow up the
Coll," she stated candidly. "You just&mdash;put
bottles into the cupboards&mdash;and don't take any
notice if he tells you to get out and boil yourself.
He does say these sort of things. He's a beast of
a temper," Noreen added kindly.</p>

<p>"When do I begin?" Joey asked.</p>

<p>"Tidying the Lab? Well, I shouldn't waste
any time," Syb chimed in. "As soon as you get
to Redlands, I should say&mdash;anyone would show
you where it is."</p>

<p>"Righto!" Joey told them, with outward
cheerfulness, though inward tremors. "Anything
else?"</p>

<p>Noreen's blue eyes had an odd gleam. "Not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span>
much. You lace up the Senior Prefect's boots;
she is Ingrid Latimer&mdash;and ... and ... write
out the supper menus for cook."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" shrieked Joey.</p>

<p>"Oh, don't you remember, Noreen, they
stopped that because Mary Hertford wrote like
a diseased spider," Syb contributed. "The
scholarship kid only ... only...."</p>

<p>She choked.</p>

<p>"You're not having me on?" demanded Joey.</p>

<p>"My dear Kid; go to the Lab when you get
there, and see if we are."</p>

<p>The train stopped. "Mote Deep" flashed before
their eyes. The station for Redlands was
reached. Joey grasped her things and asked no
further questions. She was there!</p>

<p>She stood forlornly by her suit-case on the
platform, while the rest fell upon some other
girls waiting for them there. Joey stood apart.
Noreen seemed to be telling some story in an
emphatic whisper, a funny story evidently, for
everybody shrieked with laughter, except one
freckled girl, who said lazily, "What a shame!"
and looked towards Joey as though she had half
a mind to come and speak to her. Joey hoped
that she would, but she didn't. It was Syb who
came at last, when all the luggage had been got
out and piled in the rather ancient cabs which
still did duty in Little Holland.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p>"We're going to walk, Jocelyn; of course you
can come with us if you like, but considering all
the extra things a scholarship kid has to start
with, p'r'aps you'd better cab it."</p>

<p>Joey was proud, and the inference was rather
plain. They didn't want her company.</p>

<p>"I should have cabbed it anyhow. I'd rather,"
she told Syb, with decision, and walked off in
the direction of the cabs, her head held very high.</p>

<p>She got into the first, and sat on the edge
of the rather mildewy cushions, trying to face
things out. It was all rather different from
what she had pictured; but Mums needn't know
that. And she wouldn't have to worry about the
girls and their unfriendly ways at present anyhow,
for she had the Lab to put tidy, and afterwards
that other unknown terror, the lacing up
of the Head Girl's boots.</p>

<p>If only she could have travelled with Miss
Craigie or someone friendly, she could have
asked how and when all these things were done;
but Father had always said, "Don't grouse over
what might have been; get on to what is." What
is, appeared to be tidying the Lab for the ill-tempered
French Professor; Joey settled to get
on to that at once.</p>

<p>The cab was jolting along a flat marsh road
that lay between a rolling sea of green. The
real sea was not visible, for a white mist lay on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>
the horizon, but the taste and the tang on her
lips was salt, and there was a wonderful sense
of space and freshness around her. Nothing
broke the flatness of the landscape but here and
there a squat church tower in the midst of a cluster
of cottages.</p>

<p>Presently another tower drew her attention,
a tall, gaunt tower, seeming like a warning, uplifted
finger raising itself in the peaceful sea of
green as if to say, "Watch!" Joey wondered
what its story might be. She craned her head
out of the cab window to look back at it, long
after it was receding into distance, and was
so absorbed in it that she was taken by surprise
when the cab stopped before high ornamented
iron gates, and the cabman shouted something
indistinguishable. A pleasant-looking woman
ran out, and swung the great gates back. This
was Redlands. Joey began to feel a little quaky,
though she tried to pretend it was all rather fun.
The pretence wasn't very successful at that moment;
but at least she knew what was expected
of her on arrival. That was a decided comfort.</p>

<p>She looked before her with quite as much interest
as she looked behind, while the cab
crawled down the long, straight drive towards
the irregular mass of dim red brick veiled in
ivy. Architecturally, Redlands College left
something to be desired, as it had been altered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span>
and added to at different times by people of
widely differing views; but the whole had been
mellowed together in a district where even new
red brick hardly stares above a month; and presented
to its world a silent, solid dignity.</p>

<p>Joe looked from the original Redlands, an
early seventeenth century Manor House, to the
wing built on by Madame H&egrave;rbert, who kept a
flourishing school for young ladies of quality in
the stormy days of the Second James, and on
to the additions of two centuries later, and the
Swimming Bath, Gymnasium, and Laboratories
marking the further requirements of the twentieth
century and the march of education.</p>

<p>Joey was no authority on architecture, however,
and did not come to know all this till she
had been some days at Redlands. Just then
she merely thought that the place looked jolly,
though about twice as big as she had expected.</p>

<p>The cab drew up before the flight of steps
leading to the front door; Joey jumped out.
A highly superior parlour-maid appeared before
she had time to ring the bell. Probably
she had heard the crunching of the many cab
wheels on the gravel. Joey spoke at once.
"Please could you direct me to the Chemical
Lab? They told me to go there at once."</p>

<p>The maid looked a little surprised. "Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
Conyngham will be back soon, miss," she said
hesitatingly. "Hadn't you better wait?"</p>

<p>"I was told to go there," Joe said firmly, and
the maid pointed to a building on the right,
rather behind the main block. "That's the Lab,
miss; but unless the Professor is there you won't
be able to go in. It's locked."</p>

<p>"I'll try anyhow," Joey told her, and walked
off in the direction pointed out.</p>

<p>She went up two steps to the door of the Lab.
Joey went up them cautiously, as when they
played hide-and-seek at home and somebody
was likely to spring out and catch you. But no
furious professor sprang, and Joey tried the
door, and found it was locked, but on the outside.
So she turned the key and went in, with
the words, "Please, I've come to tidy," ready on
her lips.</p>

<p>But there was no one to whom to say them;
the Lab was quite empty, though it certainly
looked as though it had not been empty for long.
Bottles stood upon a table, and two or three
saucers containing various powders, and a large
scented silk handkerchief of violet hue lay on
the floor beside a dark closet with open door.</p>

<p>Joey began to tidy as well as she could. She
used her handkerchief for a duster, and presently,
finding it rather small, took up the violet
one, which was already tolerably dirty and therefore<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[Pg 40]</a></span>
might be dirtier without mattering, she
thought.</p>

<p>She did not put the bottles away, in case the
Professor should come back and want them, but
she took them off the table and dusted it, and
then put them back in orderly rows. The saucers
she wisely did not touch, except to dust
underneath them. Then she attacked the dark
closet, which was surrounded by shelves, holding
innumerable saucers, trays, bottles, and boxes.
A good many of these things were on the floor.
Joey rammed her dusters into the pockets of
her coat, and set to work to find a safer resting-place
for them. She was really interested by
now in this duty which had been thrust upon her
in right of her scholarship; so absorbed indeed
that she never heard an exclamation at the door
and a quick step across the room. She noticed
nothing till the half-open door of the closet was
wrenched violently wide. And she sprang round
to find herself looking into the furious light eyes
of the French Professor.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="4">IV</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">Enter Gabrielle</small></h2>

<p>He was a short man, this Monsieur Trouville,
neat and dapper, though inclined to
be fat. His high forehead peaked up to his receding
hair, his short moustache was stiffly waxed
and stood out very black against his pallid face.
He was not ill-looking, but just at that moment
Joey thought she had never seen anyone quite so
unpleasant.</p>

<p>He caught her by the arm. "What are you
doing here? How dare you come? Do you
not know it is forbidden, except when I take
the classes here? I will report you to Miss
Conyngham. You shall be expelled."</p>

<p>Joey stood her ground. "You can't expel
people when they've only just come," she assured
him stoutly. "It ... isn't done. Besides,
I'm all right to tidy here. I'm the scholarship
girl."</p>

<p>This last statement did not appear to mitigate
Monsieur Trouville's fury in the least.</p>

<p>"You have distairbed all my bottles&mdash;you
have made for me hours of work with your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[Pg 42]</a></span>
disobedience," he snarled. "I vill have you
punished&mdash;you shall be no more at Redlands!"</p>

<p>He began to cast about the room, like a blood-hound
nosing for a trail. Joey felt rather frightened;
there was no doubt about it, Monsieur
Trouville was really angry. He spluttered out
the objurgations in his strong French accent
rather like an angry cat. Somehow, in spite of
what Noreen and Syb had said, she had not expected
him to be quite so much annoyed by her
presence.</p>

<p>"I'm awfully sorry if I've mixed your bottles,"
she told him, trying to speak steadily. "I didn't
mean to. Perhaps some time when you're not
too busy you would just show me how you like
things tidied, and then&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Monsieur Trouville made three strides towards
her, with so menacing an expression that
Joey gave back a step in spite of herself.</p>

<p>"Miss Conyngham tell you to say dat?" he
demanded.</p>

<p>"No, of course not. Do you suppose one
needs <em>telling</em> to be polite?" Joey answered, growing
angry in her turn. "If you don't want your
old Lab tidied for you I'm sure I don't want to
do it. Good-bye."</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="Illustration_HOW_DARE_YOU_COME" id="Illustration_HOW_DARE_YOU_COME"><img src="images/howdare.jpg" alt="Howdare" width="432" height="662" /></a>
<p class="caption">"HOW DARE YOU COME?"</p>
</div>

<p>And Joey departed with all the dignity that
she could muster, though she felt a good deal
more like crying. The Professor's suspicious attitude<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[Pg 43]</a></span>
was rather hurting. "He couldn't have
been a worse beast if he thought I meant to steal
his bottles," she told herself.</p>

<p>She was half-way back towards the front
door before she discovered she <em>had</em> stolen something
from the Lab after all. Fumbling for the
handkerchief which was rather badly wanted at
that moment, she brought out a curiously unfamiliar
one of violet silk, now excessively grubby.
She looked at it with dismay. What wouldn't
the Professor do if she went back and told him
that to add to her other offences she had used his
handkerchief for a duster.</p>

<p>"I'd better wash it first before I return it,"
Joey said to herself, and rammed it back into
her pocket.</p>

<p>She wondered whether Noreen and the others
had turned up yet; it would be satisfactory to
tell them that she had done the Lab already.
Joey thought that she would not say anything
about the Professor's fury, which, after all, had
been unjust. She put her head down, and raced
at her best pace for the front door; it would be
rather fun to talk as though the Professor had
been quite pleased with her tidying.</p>

<p>Phut! Joey had gone full tilt into someone
who was coming from the house&mdash;a very tall
girl with her hair tied back. "Here, look where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span>
you're going, you young idiot!" the big girl
called out angrily.</p>

<p>Joey came to earth metaphorically with a
bump. "I say, I'm frightfully sorry. Did I
hurt you?"</p>

<p>"That's not likely, considering you're half my
size," said the tall girl. "But you should look.
What's your name?"</p>

<p>"Jocelyn Graham. What's yours?"</p>

<p>The tall girl frowned. "I am Ingrid Latimer,
Senior Prefect here," she said coldly, and Joey
understood that she had done the wrong thing
in asking that off-hand question.</p>

<p>She became rather flustered. "Oh, are you?
Then&mdash;when do you want your boots put on?"
she asked nervously.</p>

<p>Ingrid frowned more alarmingly. "What on
earth are you talking about?"</p>

<p>"I got the scholarship&mdash;don't I have to put
your boots on?" faltered Joey. Now she came
to put it into words it did sound an extremely
silly thing to say. Somehow she wasn't surprised
by the crushing tone of the Senior Prefect's
answer.</p>

<p>"Please don't try to be funny; we've no use
for that sort of thing here. Who put you up to
all this?"</p>

<p>A light began to break upon Joey. Something
hot surged in her chest. "Oughtn't I to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span>
have tidied the Lab either?" she asked, with the
courage of desperation.</p>

<p>"Tidied the Lab! Why, no one's allowed
there without Monsieur or the Chemistry Mistress.
Look here, my good child, are you trying
to be funny&mdash;I shouldn't, because it won't pay
you&mdash;or are you the outsidest edge of imbecile
new kids that ever came to Redlands?"</p>

<p>Joey was silent. She was trying to adjust
things in her mind. The girls had had her on,
and oh how easily! She <em>was</em> the outsidest edge
in imbeciles, she supposed.</p>

<p>"Who put you up to all this?" repeated the
Senior Prefect magisterially.</p>

<p>Joey stuck her hands into her pockets. She
had been made a fool of; well, it wasn't pleasant,
but one must grin and bear it, even the hateful
apologising to the justly incensed Professor,
which she supposed must be her next proceeding.
She wasn't going to get the others into
trouble anyway, and Ingrid Latimer's tone suggested
trouble ahead. "Oh, never mind!" she
said.</p>

<p>"I wish to know," Ingrid repeated. "Their
names, please?"</p>

<p>"Sorry, it can't be done," Joey stuck out hardily.
"And if you don't want your boots put on,
I'll go&mdash;please!"</p>

<p>The Senior Prefect looked as though she could<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[Pg 46]</a></span>
hardly believe her ears; but Joey hadn't been
educated up to Senior Prefects and their expressions.
She bolted straight back to the Lab; it
would be best to get that hateful apology over
at once.</p>

<p>But the door was locked, this time on the inside,
and though she knocked till her knuckles
were sore, there was no answer.</p>

<p>"Hi, Jocelyn Graham, you're to go to Miss
Conyngham," shouted a familiar voice, and
Noreen hove in sight round the corner.</p>

<p>Joey saw her opportunity. "Tell that to
some other idiot, if you can find one silly enough
to listen to the sort of things you say," she told
her. "Personally, I find it jolly interesting to
see what a kid like you will try on next; but
even I don't want too much funniness, thank
you."</p>

<p>She marched off, leaving an outraged and astounded
Noreen staring after her, and betook
herself to the sleepy stream meandering at the
bottom of the garden. It was a comfort to feel
that Noreen had not succeeded in having her on
a third time, but it was about all the comfort
there was. Joey felt desperately home-sick and
miserable just then, and as if she would give
anything in the world to find herself on the
heathy moor, or making bannocks for tea in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[Pg 47]</a></span>
kitchen of the little grey stone cottage, far away
from this puzzling and unfriendly new world.</p>

<p>She stared across the sleepy water, wondering
whether Father had felt more wretched
than this when he was a prisoner among his
enemies. Yes, of course it had been worse
for him, a great deal worse; for he had been
in the midst of dirt and ill-usage and barbarities
unspeakable&mdash;only&mdash;he hadn't expected
to find the Huns friendly gentlemen,
and Joey had somehow expected a great deal
from Redlands. Still, that was no reason for
making a fuss; Father hadn't&mdash;Joey knew
that. She screwed her eyes up tight, and
rubbed the back of a grubby hand across them
fiercely. And while she was doing that someone
spoke to her.</p>

<p>"I say, are you Jocelyn Graham?"</p>

<p>Joey opened her eyes hastily. A girl was
standing by her, a girl with long lovely auburn-brown
hair and clear eyes a shade darker,
and a delicate clear skin. She wasn't as tall
as Joey herself, anything like, and she hadn't
the superior way of talking, which Joey had
noticed in the rest.</p>

<p>"You <em>are</em> Jocelyn, aren't you?" this girl went
on, and Joey liked her way of saying it, for it
was friendly. "Well, do let me take you to Miss
Conyngham&mdash;yes, it's all right, she really wants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>
you&mdash;and she sent for you some time ago, you
know."</p>

<p>Joey remembered. Panic took hold of her.
"Will she be mad?"</p>

<p>The pretty girl smiled. "She's seeing the
other new girls. You'll be all right if we run."</p>

<p>They ran. Somehow Joey did not doubt this
new friend. "What's your name?" she asked
breathlessly, as they tore up from the stream
and across the gardens.</p>

<p>"Gabrielle&mdash;Gabrielle Arden."</p>

<p>"Why did you come after me?" Joey asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, Noreen thought you had gone down that
way."</p>

<p>"It was decent of you," Joey said, with conviction.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn&mdash;Noreen and the others didn't
mean anything, truly," Gabrielle panted.
"They didn't think you would really go and
do the Lab, you know."</p>

<p>Joey returned no answer; for one thing she
had no breath to speak; for the second, she
looked forward to a settlement, a little later on,
with Noreen and Co., when the interview with
Miss Conyngham and the hateful apology to
the Professor were well over.</p>

<p>Gabrielle said nothing more either, and the
two arrived in silence at Miss Conyngham's
door. Miss Conyngham herself opened it, shepherding<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[Pg 49]</a></span>
out three girls who looked new and
rather frightened.</p>

<p>"Ah, Gabrielle, that's right," Miss Conyngham
said. "Kathleen Ronaldshay has no elder
sisters here; will you take care of her and show
her round? And here is Jocelyn. I will introduce
all you new girls to each other, and then
I want a little talk with Jocelyn alone."</p>

<p>Joey shook hands with Bernadine Elton,
Kathleen Ronaldshay, and Ella Marne; then the
three were sent off in Gabrielle's care&mdash;they
were all of them much bigger than she was&mdash;and
Miss Conyngham drew Jocelyn into her pretty
room.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham matched her room; she was
dainty and fair and fragile-looking, and, as Joey
mentioned afterwards to Mums, "looked as if a
light were burning inside her which made her all
lit up as soon as she began to talk."</p>

<p>She did not look as though she could keep
six hundred girls in order; but Joey found out
very soon that appearances were deceitful in this
case. Just now, however, Miss Conyngham was
not out to keep anyone in order.</p>

<p>"I was so sorry that you and Miss Craigie
couldn't come down together; but I have had a
wire, she is better, and the temperature very
much down this morning. So I hope we may
get her back in a fortnight. And by that time<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span>
I expect you will have made hosts of friends,
and have a tremendous amount to tell her."</p>

<p>Joey assented cautiously. Privately she
doubted the friends, and it certainly wouldn't
be possible to tell Miss Craigie that she hated
Redlands for fear it should go back to Mums
<em>via</em> the minister. But an assent of some kind
seemed the proper thing.</p>

<p>"You will be placed in Remove II. B; that is
the head form of the Lower School," Miss
Conyngham went on. "Gabrielle, who brought
you here, is in that form, only she is A: she is
Head of the Lower School, you know, and only
thirteen; we are all proud of Gabrielle at Redlands."</p>

<p>"Is she top of this Remove place, then?" asked
Joey.</p>

<p>"Not necessarily. The Head of the Lower
School is chosen from Remove II., but it is in
open Election among the other girls. They vote
for the best in every way out of sixty Remove
girls; you want a great many qualities to be
Head of the Lower School, Jocelyn."</p>

<p>Joey was interested. She somehow hadn't
guessed that Gabrielle was anything special, except
good-natured to a new girl.</p>

<p>"The election of the Head Girl for the two
hundred and fifty of the Upper School, and for
the three hundred and fifty of the Lower, happens<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[Pg 51]</a></span>
at the end of every year," Miss Conyngham
went on, in a nice companionable way, as
though she were quite sure that Joey would be
interested, and feel the school matters her own.
"It is a very serious affair, I can assure you. The
result of the Election holds good for the whole
succeeding year; at Christmas Gabrielle will
stand for re-election&mdash;that is, if she doesn't pass
out of Remove into the Upper School. By the
end of the term all this will have come to mean
a very great deal to you, I think."</p>

<p>Joey's assent was again a model of caution;
of course, Miss Conyngham didn't realise how
the girls resented that village school. Probably
Gabrielle had just been nice because she did not
know.</p>

<p>"Well, now it must be tea-time," Miss Conyngham
concluded, "and you must go and have
tea. Give Matron your keys afterwards, and
she will show you where to put away your
clothes."</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham consulted a list pinned on
her wall. "You are in Blue Dormitory, I see;
that is a very favourite one. I will ask Gabrielle
to introduce you to your room-mates, Sybil
Gray, Barbara Emerson, and Noreen O'Hara.
I think you will all get on very comfortably together."</p>

<p>Joey did not even give a cautious assent to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[Pg 52]</a></span>
this; she thought she knew exactly how that
quartette were going to get on. She just said,
"Thank you, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham rang the bell twice. A minute
later there was a tap at the door, and Gabrielle
answered her "Come in."</p>

<p>"Take Jocelyn in to tea and show her her dormitory,
Gabrielle, please," Miss Conyngham
said. She did not add, "Take care of her," for
which Joey was grateful. It was bad enough
to be disliked by the rest, but at least she needn't
be despised. No one should guess that she
wasn't feeling happy at Redlands.</p>

<p>"Which dorm are you in?" Gabrielle asked,
as soon as Miss Conyngham's door was shut behind
them.</p>

<p>"Blue," Joey said briefly.</p>

<p>"That's topping. It's next door to mine, and
such a jolly set there."</p>

<p>"I know," Joey interrupted rather grimly.
"Sybil and Barbara and Noreen."</p>

<p>"Do you know them, then?" asked Gabrielle,
surprised.</p>

<p>"We met in the train," Joey explained. She
hesitated for a second. "I shall <em>like</em> being in
their dorm."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="5">V</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">Liveliness in Blue Dorm</small></h2>

<p>Tea was over&mdash;a tea which seemed a babel
to Joey's unaccustomed ears, although
Cousin Greta would probably have laughed at
the term "unaccustomed," considering the noise
that the five Grahams could make among themselves.</p>

<p>But Cousin Greta would never have guessed
what a great school could do at the first meal,
with discipline relaxed and everybody trying to
tell special friends how they had spent the holidays.</p>

<p>Joey sat under the wing of a very young
mistress, who wore a great bunch of violets in her
belt, and was addressed as "Miss Lambton."
She saw to it that Joey had plenty of bread and
jam and cake, and addressed two or three good-natured
questions to her; but it wasn't in the nature
of things that the new girl shouldn't feel
rather out of it, when all near neighbours wanted
to tell Miss Lambton where they had been and
what they had done, and she had to interrupt
her adorers in order to speak to Joey. Gabrielle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[Pg 54]</a></span>
had been swamped directly they came into the
huge refectory by two vehement people, with a
tiny silver shield fastened to their djibbahs, who
assured her vociferously that she had promised
to sit between them for the first tea last term.</p>

<p>However, she remembered the new girl directly
tea was over, and made her way to Joey's
side, when the girls rose from table.</p>

<p>"Will you come to your dorm now?"</p>

<p>"I've got to go and say something to the Professor
in Lab," Joey said doubtfully, not being
at all sure that when she reached Blue Dorm
she wouldn't be expected to stay there interviewing
Matron, or something of that kind.</p>

<p>"Oh, come on, Gabrielle, if the new kid doesn't
<em>want</em> to be shown her dormitory, don't fag over
her," urged two or three impatient voices; but
Gabrielle stood her ground.</p>

<p>"I quite forgot. Ingrid Latimer&mdash;she's Senior
Prefect&mdash;of course, you don't know her yet&mdash;sent
me a message for you. She said the Lab
was all right, and she had seen Monsieur Trouville.
I don't know what it means, but perhaps
you do."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know," Joey answered shortly. It
had been kind of the Senior Prefect to face the
furious Professor for her, and Gabrielle seemed
kind and friendly, too; but you couldn't tell
about these girls. They despised her because of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[Pg 55]</a></span>
Calgarloch school, and she never knew when
they would have set her on about something else.
She didn't feel inclined to be effusive.</p>

<p>Gabrielle shook off her admirers and conducted
Joey up many stairs and along many
passages in silence. Only when she had opened
the door of a large, light, airy room, with blue-washed
walls and blue quilts to the four beds and
blue curtains to the windows, did she find her
voice again.</p>

<p>"This is Blue Dorm, Jocelyn. I'm sure you'll
like it. Isn't it a topping view? Look how
well you can see the Fossdyke Wash&mdash;and that's
the Walpole Fen, all down on the right&mdash;it's
reclaimed, you know&mdash;and do you see that tower?"</p>

<p>"Yes; I saw it coming along. What is it?"
asked Joey, coming a little more out of her shell.</p>

<p>Gabrielle sunk her voice to an impressive
whisper. "It's haunted&mdash;it is really, Jocelyn.
Of course Miss Conyngham and the sensible
people would say nonsense; but we've heard awfully
queer sounds sometimes, and once I saw
some blue light with my own eyes, when Doron
Westerby&mdash;another four had this dorm last term&mdash;had
toothache in the night, and called me.
You know a man was murdered there; ages
back, it was. His enemy tied him up in an underground
room of the tower, and then blew<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span>
out a bit of the sea-wall at one of the great
autumn tides."</p>

<p>Joey gasped. "How beastly. Are his mouldering
bones there now?"</p>

<p>"I think they're cleared up," Gabrielle said regretfully.
"You look for the light, Jocelyn&mdash;you'll
have a topping chance. I wonder which
bed you'll have&mdash;three have windows, you see;
it's only in that fourth one by the door you can't
see anything, and I don't think it's fixed yet
who sleeps there."</p>

<p>As if in answer to her words, there was a
stampede outside, and the three other owners
of Blue Dorm rushed headlong in. Each carried
something in her hand&mdash;a book, a comb,
a handkerchief. With one consent they rushed
upon the three window beds, and hurling the
article upon it, shouted breathlessly, "Bags I
this!"</p>

<p>Gabrielle got rather red. She walked up to
Syb and spoke in a low voice. Joey caught the
words "a new girl" and "playing up." But
whatever her appeal might be, it hadn't much effect.
Joey marched over to the bed by the door.</p>

<p>"This is mine, then," she said.</p>

<p>Matron came in a minute later, in her usual
hurry, demanding keys and everyone's attention
instantly. Gabrielle was dispatched to the
big basement room downstairs to help in the unpacking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span>
and putting away of her things; and
Joey found she was expected to do the same, after
Matron had shown her exactly where and
how her things should go, and explained that
there was a dormitory inspection, inside and out,
of drawers and cupboards every Saturday of
term.</p>

<p>Joey ran upstairs with armfuls of clothes, and
downstairs to get more for a long time after
that; but at last everything was put away, and
Matron, weary and a trifle dishevelled, made a
tour of inspection before going to see the babies
into bed.</p>

<p>The four in Blue Dorm were left to arrange
their photographs and private belongings before
changing into their white frocks for supper.
Joey got to work on her shelf and combined
chest of drawers and dressing-table silently and
unsociably. The others had a great deal to say
to each other, and took no notice of her for some
little time. Then Sybil, who had finished, came
strolling up to the corner by the door, and cast a
glance over Joey's photographs.</p>

<p>"I say, what an awfully good-looking boy,"
she said, picking up the photo of Gavin, taken
for Mums out of the tip Uncle Staff sent him
when he won the scholarship. "Who's he&mdash;your
brother?"</p>

<p>The devil entered into Joey. "No; that's the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span>
flesher's boy in Calgarloch, a great pal of mine,"
she stated easily, arranging Mums side by side
with Father in uniform.</p>

<p>Syb stared. Joey went on. "The kid in socks
is the gravedigger's youngest&mdash;he's called Bingo;
and these two, Ronnie and Kirsty, belong to the
odd-and-end shop at Crumach."</p>

<p>With which appalling size in thumpers, Joey
turned her back upon the girls, and went on arranging
her photographs. Syb left her in a
hurry; the others whispered together. Joey
finished her corner, and got out her evening
frock.</p>

<p>"Having us on?" asked Noreen, with a doubtful
note of appreciation.</p>

<p>Joey slipped her frock over her head. "Find
out," she suggested.</p>

<p>That made a pause, and everybody put on
their evening dresses in silence. Barbara broke
it while hair was being brushed.</p>

<p>"I suppose Gabrielle told you that this dorm
tubs at night," she observed unwillingly. "You
had better not be late coming up, because the
water gets cold so quickly."</p>

<p>"But of course you'd bath last because of being
new," Syb joined in, rather truculently.</p>

<p>Joey made no answer; she was considering.
"Where is the bathroom?" she asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[Pg 59]</a></span></p>

<p>"Right opposite. Blue Dorm uses No. 8,"
Barbara vouchsafed.</p>

<p>"Thank you," Joey answered, with extraordinary
meekness, a meekness that was almost
overdone. These horrid swanky girls had forced
her to accept the worst corner of the room, but it
was certainly nearest the door, and Joey was
quite clear in her own mind which of the Blue
Dorm occupants was going to have first tub to-night.</p>

<p>They went down to supper after that; the
three together, and Joey behind. There was a
very nice supper laid in the huge refectory;
but Joey was home-sick for the little sitting-room
at Calgarloch and the brandered herrings
and the brown bread, and Robina, the lass, bringing
in the pudding, and joining freely in the conversation
if she felt inclined.</p>

<p>Joey sat between two rather big girls, and
they only spoke once to her to ask her name and
age, and then talked hockey across her for the
rest of the meal. Not that Joey cared; she assured
herself that she didn't want to be friends
with these girls.</p>

<p>There was dancing after supper in the Queen's
Hall, but Joey looked on. Dancing wasn't
taught at Calgarloch, and she refused decidedly
when Gabrielle came and asked for a valse.
And then at nine there were prayers, and the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span>
whole of the Upper School, with Remove II. A
and B of the Lower, filed past Miss Conyngham
and said good-night. The Juniors had been
swept off a good deal earlier.</p>

<p>Joey was really glad when bedtime came.
She was longing to get a bit of her own back.
Noreen and Co. had taken her in, and made an
utter fool of her over the tidying of the Lab
and the putting on of the Head Girl's boots;
but Joey wasn't going to sit down meekly
under the treatment. She managed to plant
herself just in front of Sybil, Barbara, and
Noreen in the long procession; and before she
went downstairs she had put out her towel,
sponges, etc., where she could snatch them easily.
The procession moved on; and she moved with
it.</p>

<p>She could hear Miss Conyngham's clear, mellow
voice, "Good-night, Jacynth. Good-night,
Mary. Good-night, Doron&mdash;oh, what about that
tooth? Has it given you more trouble?"</p>

<p>Block number one. Joey heard Syb's
grumble behind. "Bother Doron's toothache&mdash;the
water will be cold."</p>

<p>Doron's toothache was much better, thank
you; yes, the stuff had done it a lot of good; she
wouldn't want any more, she thought. "Thank
you, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span></p>

<p>Doron Westerby moved on; so did the procession.</p>

<p>"Good-night, Sylvia. Good-night, Trixie.
Good-night, Cecily. Good-night, Kathleen&mdash;any
more news from home, dear?"</p>

<p>Block number two. Joey wondered if Syb's
exaggerated groan would be heard by Miss
Conyngham; they were so near her now.</p>

<p>Yes, Kathleen had heard from home, and
Frankie was better. His temperature had gone
down three degrees, thank you, Miss Conyngham.</p>

<p>Kathleen was disposed of. "Good-night,
Thelma. Good-night, Winifred. Good-night&mdash;oh,
it's you, Jocelyn? Settled your things comfortably
into the Blue Dormitory?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thank you, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>"That's right. Sleep well. Good-night,
Jocelyn."</p>

<p>The procession moved on. Joey was out of the
Queen's Hall and on the stairs. Up them three
steps at a time&mdash;the long legs at which Calgarloch
stared amazed were certainly of use now.
Behind her she heard Syb and Barbara disputing
whose turn it was to have first bath. As the
turn had to be remembered across the width of
the holidays that was a difficult matter to decide.
Joey chuckled inwardly; they really
needn't worry themselves to remember. She<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span>
plunged at the door of Blue Dorm and grabbed
her things, including pyjamas and dressing-gown.
Too late; the other three saw what she
meant to do.</p>

<p>"Here, you are last for the bathroom," Syb
shouted.</p>

<p>Joey dived across the passage and flung herself
and her belongings into Bathroom 8. "I
don't think!" she said succinctly, as she slammed
the bolt home.</p>

<p>Joey enjoyed her bath. She took as much hot
water as she wanted, and didn't come out, whatever
the bangings and objurgations outside the
door, till she had been in the bath as long as
she wished. Then at last she emerged, to face
a furious trio waiting for her in Blue Dorm.</p>

<p>Joey plumped down her armful of belongings
on her bed. "I should hurry," she advised politely.
"The tap was beginning to run cooler
before I left."</p>

<p>Syb bolted to the bathroom; the other two
turned their backs studiously upon the aggressor,
and talked ostentatiously to one another.
Joey curled up on her bed, did her hair in three
bangs, and then wrote up her diary for the first
day at Redlands.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"Redlands is a hole, and the girls are pigs. I
hate them all, except p'r'aps Gabrielle. They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span>
think it a fair disgrace to have been at a council
school, and say beastly things. I wish I was
seventeen this minute, and coming away: I'll
never get a bit of paper big enough to cross off
all the hateful horrid days I've got to stay here.
I have settled never to say a single word to any
of these hateful horrid swanky girls, except,
p'r'aps Gabrielle, as long as I live."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The letter to Mums, which was also written
while the other three bathed in tepid water with
much bitterness of spirit, expressed a rather different
view.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It's frightfully pretty here," Joey wrote,
"and the Wash lies on the edge of what you see&mdash;all
glittering&mdash;and the river is mixed up with
it, and the Deeps are like another sea, only green
grass. The College is awfully nice, and some of
it is very ancient and historical. I'll tell you the
history bits when I've mugged them up. I'm
in Blue Dorm, and that's the nicest Dorm. I
have the bed nearest the door, and that's frightfully
handy for getting first bath. My room-companions
are Sybil, Barbara, and Noreen
O'Hara. They were very interested in my photographs.
I'm going to have a topping time
here, I can see, and I should think I'm in the
liveliest dorm that ever was.&mdash;Your loving</p>

<p class="signed">
"<span class="small-caps">Joey</span>."<br />
</p>

<p>"P.S.&mdash;You might write soon; I'm frightfully
happy here, still you might write."</p>

</blockquote>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span></p>

<p>A bell rang just as Joey had finished her letter,
and a stentorian voice in the passage cried,
"Silence for prayers."</p>

<p>Noreen O'Hara rushed from the bathroom, after
a tub lasting a short two minutes, and hurled
herself upon her knees among her sponges and
bath-towel. A minute later a Prefect looked in,
and withdrew noiselessly.</p>

<p>There was absolute quiet for some seven or
eight minutes, and then a little murmur arose
again.</p>

<p>Joey had dropped her writing-things and said
her prayers like the rest. She wondered if she
ought to feel ashamed of her behaviour with the
bath; the sad thing was that she didn't, particularly.
And if she said she was sorry now, the
furious three would think she was afraid of what
they might do to her. Joey decided to stick it
out, but have a shorter and a cooler bath to-morrow.</p>

<p>Another bell rang. Noreen and Syb were already
in bed; Barbara jumped up at the bell,
and Joey more slowly followed her example.
The Prefect looked in again.</p>

<p>"All in bed&mdash;that's right." She turned to put
out the light. "Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Ingrid," said the injured three
in a burst. "Good-night," said Joey pointedly
by herself when the others had finished.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span></p>

<p>Ingrid Latimer looked in her direction.
"Why, it's the new kid."</p>

<p>She came across to Joey's bed. "Got my message,
young 'un?"</p>

<p>"Yes, thanks awfully."</p>

<p>"That's all right. He won't think any more
of it. You come to me, if anybody tries on that
sort of game again. You'll always find some
fat-headed idiots in Coll who think it funny.
Good-night."</p>

<p>"Good-night, and thanks no end."</p>

<p>Ingrid turned the light out. Blue Dorm was
left in outward peace. It was outward only!</p>

<small class="small-caps">A Night on the Leads</small></h2>

<p>Ingrid's steps&mdash;alert, responsible&mdash;died
away into distance. Silence settled down.
Then Sybil drew a long breath, and spoke in
accents which were hushed, but audible.</p>

<p>"Of all the utterly mean young skunks!"</p>

<p>"Disgusting!" Noreen agreed.</p>

<p>"But I suppose she hasn't learnt anything better,"
said Barbara.</p>

<p>Joey wriggled in bed, but held her tongue.
Let them go on; they wouldn't hurt her.</p>

<p>"Such a pig about the bath-water&mdash;I hardly
washed at all," Syb went on.</p>

<p>"Frightfully lowering to Redlands to turn
that sort in," Barbara took up the parable.</p>

<p>Joey couldn't keep out of the fray any longer.
"Did the Redlands girls want to have a nice kind
fat old nurse apiece to look after them and keep
them from being contaminated by less select
people?" she jeered. "Poor little dears!"</p>

<p>"We're not talking to you, Jocelyn Graham.
We don't talk to girls who behave as you do,"
Sybil told her icily.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span></p>

<p>"Righto. Don't then," Joey said, and turned
over in bed.</p>

<p>But the outraged three had not finished by
any manner of means.</p>

<p>"Sucking up and sneaking to Ingrid Latimer,
too; I do call that the limit," Noreen went on.
"Notice how she jawed <em>at</em> us&mdash;and I adored Ingrid
all last term."</p>

<p>Joey was too proud to speak again after her
recent snub, or she might have informed them
that she had <em>not</em> sneaked to Ingrid Latimer. As
it was&mdash;let them think it if they liked&mdash;she didn't
care.</p>

<p>"Shame to put her into Blue Dorm," that was
Barbara.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps she could be cleared out."</p>

<p>"Miss Conyngham is frightfully stuffy about
changing dorms after she and Matron have
worked it all out."</p>

<p>Joey got out of bed, shouldered into a dressing-gown,
thrust on slippers, and seized her blue
quilt.</p>

<p>"As it's rather difficult to go to sleep, while
you're making all this row, I'll sleep somewhere
else to-night, if you don't mind," she explained,
with elaborate politeness, and was out of the
door, trailing her quilt after her, before any of
the three had recovered from the blank surprise
caused by her remark.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[Pg 68]</a></span></p>

<p>When she came out of Bathroom 8, Joey
had noticed a ladder at the far end of the passage;
she guessed that it must lead on to the
roof. And what better place could one find to
sleep on than a roof, on such a fine September
night as this? Even if it rained she thought the
leads would be better than a Blue Dorm full of
hateful girls who talked at her.</p>

<p>She scrambled up the latter, stumbling over
the blue quilt; pushed open a trap-door, and arrived,
sure enough, upon the leads, all silver in
the moonlight.</p>

<p>She had been boiling over with fury when she
escaped from the Blue Dorm, but this wonderful
silver world had a calming effect. It was far
clearer now than it had been when she came.
Then a haze had hovered over the horizon; now
the broad line of the Fossdyke Wash glittered a
silver glory on the edge of the white world.</p>

<p>The great stretch of the Walpole Fen intersected
by its wide ditches unrolled itself before
her, and in the flatness that curious round tower
stood out conspicuously. Joey looked at it with
interest; it <em>was</em> curious to see a tower standing
all by itself like that. She wondered whether she
would be allowed to go and explore it sometime,
by herself of course, without the company of any
of those hateful Redlands girls. And then she
thought how interested Mums would be in hearing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
of it. And then she thought how much more
interested Mums would be if she, Joey, had seen
the redoubtable blue light which Gabrielle had
mentioned. And then she wondered if she would
see it to-night, where she would have an even better
view than if she had been allowed a window
bed. That was the last clear thought in her
mind before she found a sheltered corner, rolled
herself tightly in her quilt, and fell asleep with
her face buried in the hollow of her arm to get
away from the moonlight. She dreamt of the
tower, of course, but all her dreams were confused,
not clear.</p>

<p>She awoke at last to a sense of cold, which
had been with her for some time before it roused
her.</p>

<p>"You little pig Kirsty; you've taken all the
clothes," she murmured sleepily; and then, as
consciousness came back, she knew that she
wasn't in the familiar little bed at Pilot Cottage,
where there was just room for Kirsty and herself
and no more, but somewhere in a dark outdoor
world with no moon left and a fine rain
falling.</p>

<p>Joey stood up, holding her damp quilt about
her. Luckily, her dressing-gown was thick, but
even with that she shivered&mdash;of course she must
go inside to Blue Dorm, which seemed decidedly
attractive at that moment; only how in the world<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>
was she to find the trap-door in the dark? Joey
turned round, trying to make out the geography
of the roof, and, as she turned, something blue
shone for a moment through the drizzly darkness.
She watched the light, forgetting damp and discomfort
and the rather forlorn feeling which had
seized her. The blue light flashed out three
times and then disappeared. Almost at once
the stable clock struck two.</p>

<p>The blue light had done more than give Joey
a thrilling story for Mums: it had shown her how
she stood. When she came up through the trap-door,
the tower had been on her right. She
made straight for the trap-door in the darkness,
and landed full upon it; she felt the ring through
her bedroom slippers.</p>

<p>She knelt down and lifted it cautiously, crept
through and went down the ladder backwards
much impeded by the quilt, and with all her teeth
chattering as if they would never stop. Noiselessly
she tiptoed into Blue Dorm, found her bed,
and got into it, pulling her bedclothes tightly
round her.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, this process did not keep her
teeth from chattering, cold chills chased each
other up and down her spine, and the bed shook
with her shivering.</p>

<p>Someone spoke from one of the window beds:</p>

<p>"I say, Jocelyn!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span></p>

<p>"Thought you weren't talking to me!" Joey
inquired, as high-handedly as is possible with
teeth chattering like castanets. It was Noreen's
voice that had spoken; she recognized the faint
touch of the brogue.</p>

<p>"Are you crying?"</p>

<p>"Likely!" Joey got all the scorn possible into
that one word.</p>

<p>Noreen sat up in bed.</p>

<p>"Then what <em>are</em> you doing?"</p>

<p>"Shivering."</p>

<p>"Oh!" said Noreen, and ducked down in her
bed, because there was a step outside, and the
door opened. Ingrid came in with a candle.</p>

<p>"I thought I heard talking; is any one ill?"</p>

<p>Joey withdrew herself and her shivers well
under the bedclothes, and buried her face in the
pillow.</p>

<p>"Nothing's the matter, Ingrid," Noreen said,
rather flustered. "I just thought one of them
was awake&mdash;and asked."</p>

<p>Ingrid was in a hurry and rather cold besides.
She did not make a tour of the beds in Blue
Dorm.</p>

<p>"My dear Kid, don't wake people up to ask
if they're awake," she said. "You spoke quite
loud: I heard you in the passage, when I was
fetching stuff for Dorothy's earache. Go to
sleep, and anyhow keep quiet, please."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[Pg 72]</a></span></p>

<p>She shut the door. Noreen wisely waited for
a good five minutes before saying anything else.
Then she got out of bed and came across to Joey,
carrying her quilt.</p>

<p>"Stick this on top of yours. Goodness, you
<em>are</em> cold. Like my rug too? It's just folded at
the end of my bed; I can get it in a sec."</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," jerked poor Joey, wondering
if she ever would be warm again. Though
she didn't want to take anything from these horrid
unfriendly Redlands girls, she couldn't resist
the quilt and the rug, and Noreen's voice was
kind just then.</p>

<p>"Where <em>have</em> you been?" Noreen whispered,
as she tucked the plaid down over the two quilts.</p>

<p>"Roof," said Joey.</p>

<p>"You haven't? Up the ladder and on to the
leads. You slept there? I say, there <em>would</em>
have been a row if Ingrid found out!"</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose so," Joey acknowledged.
Her teeth were chattering rather less; it was
more possible to speak.</p>

<p>"She'd be sure to say we drove you to it,"
Noreen said. "She knew about our ragging
you...."</p>

<p>"I didn't tell her&mdash;at least when I asked about
her boots I spoke about the Lab, and she wanted
to know who told me to tidy it," Joey explained.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[Pg 73]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you tell?"</p>

<p>"No."</p>

<p>Noreen sat down on her bed.</p>

<p>"You're rather a young sport, Jocelyn. I
say, it was rather a shame about the Lab; was
the Professor a frightful beast about it?"</p>

<p>"He was rather; I think he needn't have been
so bad considering the French and we are allies
for evermore," Joey said.</p>

<p>"He's only French-Swiss; daresay he can't be
as nice as pure French," Noreen suggested
soothingly. "Anyhow, Ingrid has settled him
up&mdash;she can tackle any professor born: you
should see her with our literature prof: disagrees
with him and that sort of thing. All the same,
it was a mean shame to have you on about the
Lab, Jocelyn; I was really rather sorry about it
afterwards&mdash;only, you know, you were so uppish
about the bath."</p>

<p>The shivers had practically subsided; Joey felt
happier.</p>

<p>"I know; I shouldn't do that again."</p>

<p>"I don't blame you for getting something off
us when you had the chance," Noreen observed,
with an effort after fair play. "Good-night,
Jocelyn: I hope you'll be all right now."</p>

<p>"Good-night, Noreen; thanks ever so."</p>

<p>Joey went to sleep at last, with an idea in her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[Pg 74]</a></span>
mind that some at least of the girls at Redlands
were better than they seemed.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>No one could think how a girl who had arrived
perfectly well at four o'clock yesterday,
could manage to develop such a frightful crying
cold as Joey brought to breakfast next morning.
Miss Lambton commented upon it; her neighbors
at breakfast commented upon it with less
concern and more candour; Matron commented
upon it quite severely, while sticking a thermometer
that tasted of carbolic into Joey's unwilling
mouth, in the hall.</p>

<p>Noreen was hovering near.</p>

<p>"Please I expect that bed by the door has a
draught or something," she suggested. "Shall
I change with her? I don't mind really."</p>

<p>"Rubbish about a draught," Matron answered
briskly. "There is just as much draught by a
window. But you can change beds if you both
like&mdash;only it's not to be a precedent."</p>

<p>Matron's urbanity was possibly due to the
fact that Joey had been proved to have no temperature,
and therefore could not be convicted of
the heinous crime of sickening for measles, "flu,"
or chicken-pox.</p>

<p>"Keep a sports-coat on all day in the house,
and you are not to stand about when the ground
is wet, or stay out after four," she said, with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span>
authority. "You can run away now, but be careful.
You must have done something really silly
to get a cold like that."</p>

<p>"Come and change the beds," whispered
Noreen, and the two ran up to Blue Dorm together.</p>

<p>"Look here, it's jolly decent of you, but it
doesn't matter about changing, really," Joey
blurted out.</p>

<p>Noreen grinned engagingly.</p>

<p>"You silly cuckoo, don't you see I want to bag
your tip of 'First Bath.'"</p>

<p>But Joey knew that wasn't the real reason;
she began to like Noreen.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="7">VII</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Violet Handkerchief</small></h2>

<p>A select committee consisting of Ingrid
Latimer, Freda Martin, Joan Chichester,
and Miss Lambton, the assistant games-mistress,
tried the new girls for hockey that afternoon,
playing them with a selection from the second
hockey-team.</p>

<p>Joey enjoyed herself, though she had not
played since she was quite small and a day-girl
at a school in Hertfordshire. Her running and
her passing were both commended, the one by
Ingrid and the other by Miss Lambton; and she
was dreadfully disappointed when, at four
o'clock, Miss Lambton looked at her watch, and
said something in an undertone to Ingrid. Then
she called out:</p>

<p>"Jocelyn Graham is to go indoors now.
Change your hockey things, Jocelyn," she added,
"and you can ask for a book from the Lower
School Library."</p>

<p>Of course that bothering cold! Joey thanked
Miss Lambton, and went indoors in very low
spirits. Now that she had been reminded of her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>
cold, she felt much worse at once. Her head
and eyes were heavy; she didn't think she would
ask for a book after all. She wandered up to Blue
Dorm, and began to change very slowly, finally
taking out a clean handkerchief from the drawer,
and putting her handkerchief&mdash;her third that
day&mdash;into her linen-bag.</p>

<p>Something deep-toned showed at the bottom
of her bag, under the white of her own handkerchiefs;
of course she still had the violet silk handkerchief
which she had used to dust the Lab.
Joey decided that it would be a very good thing
to wash it, here and now, while she had the time.
She plunged her arm into the linen-bag and drew
it out. What a good thing she had needed another
handkerchief, or it would probably have
gone to the wash with her other things, and the
Professor would have had to wait till the laundry
returned it. Joey dashed into the bathroom with
the violet handkerchief, turned on some moderately
hot water, and began to scrub with vigour.
She got the dirt off fairly well, to judge by the
extraordinarily black condition of the bath; if she
could only dry it, it might be possible to return it
to the Lab this very evening. Joey didn't like
to think of the Professor wanting his handkerchief
and thinking of her as a thief as well as a
most interfering schoolgirl.</p>

<p>But how was she to dry that handkerchief?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>
Hung out over a chair in the Blue Dorm it would
certainly take all night. The late September
sun was near its setting; she couldn't dry it on
the window ledge, that was quite certain. If only
Gabrielle had been about, or even Noreen, she
might perhaps have asked whether it was allowable
to go down to the kitchens to find a fire. Already
in the twenty-four hours she had spent at
Redlands she had learnt there were several things
not allowed which would have been the ordinary
sort of thing to do at Calgarloch&mdash;and Father
had always been particular about obedience. But
both were playing hockey, and Joey was still
cautious about the others. Probably she would
be had on again, if she asked strangers.</p>

<p>She went down two flights of stairs, holding
the wet handkerchief crumpled in her hand,
and wondering what she had better do. Then
she saw a door open, and heard a babel of small
voices coming from behind it, and&mdash;surprising
sight, a glow of firelight. She pushed the door
open a very little farther, and peeped in.</p>

<p>About twelve or fourteen very small girls,
their ages ranging from six or seven to nine, were
sitting in a huge half-circle round a bright fire.
They were all talking hard, regardless of a pleasant-looking
maid who was laying tea&mdash;a very
nice tea, with plenty of bread and jam, and a
plate of round, shiny-topped buns.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">[Pg 79]</a></span></p>

<p>They all stopped chattering though, when they
caught sight of Joey, and stared at her solemnly
in absolute silence. Still, she couldn't be uncomfortable
with people of that age, even if they
hadn't reminded her so much of Kirsty and
Bingo.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I come in and dry something
by your fire?" she asked.</p>

<p>The children received the request most graciously,
scrambling aside to make room for her
in the middle of the circle, and helping her to
hang the handkerchief over the high nursery fender.</p>

<p>"Is it your hankserchiff?" asked a small, solemn
voice, while she was spreading it out; and
she turned round to meet the grave, dark eyes
of the very tiniest child she had ever seen at
school. She was about half Bingo's size, but
she spoke quite distinctly, except for the mispronunciation
of the word handkerchief. Her
black hair was cut square over her forehead and
bobbed; her small, round face had very little
colour, and except for the amount of expression
in it and the fact that she was talking, Joey could
almost have taken her for a French doll.</p>

<p>"No, it's not mine; it's one I borrowed, so I
washed it," she explained, and then she pulled
the tiny child upon her lap, as she sat on the
floor.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[Pg 80]</a></span></p>

<p>"What's your name, I wonder?"</p>

<p>"Bertillia," breathed the mite, pronouncing all
the syllables quite distinctly, and looking solemnly
up at Joey as she spoke.</p>

<p>"But we call her Tiddles," said a jolly-looking,
round-faced person on Joey's right. "At least
the big ones did first, and we caught it off them.
And she's like a Tiddles, isn't she&mdash;just a sort
of little kitten thing you can pick up."</p>

<p>"You squeeze me when you pick me up,
Ros-ie," Tiddles stated.</p>

<p>"How old is she?" Joey asked, cuddling
Tiddles close, as she cuddled Bingo, when he
allowed it&mdash;which wasn't often.</p>

<p>"Oh, she's six&mdash;but isn't she small&mdash;people
think she's only two or three," Rosie answered.
"She's Belgian, you know, and Miss Conyngham
has taken her 'cause she's got nobody. Her
mother got killed, and the one who brought her
to England died of tiredness, poor thing&mdash;she
had to walk and walk and carry Tiddles. She
found her, you know; and look what those pigly
Germans had done to her. Show your arm, Tiddles,
darling."</p>

<p>Tiddles, who had listened seriously and unwinkingly
to her mournful story, related so very
cheerfully by Rosie, gave a funny little nod, and
pulled up the loose sleeve of her tiny blouse.
On the small arm was a long, deep scar.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did the Huns&mdash;&mdash;?" Joey gasped.</p>

<p>"Yes, though she was just a tiny baby. We're
never going to speak to a German again as long
as we live," Rosie stated firmly. "We've settled
that; we shall just look the other way if we meet
one, as though he was a bad smell. Poor Tiddles!"</p>

<p>Tiddles had been staring at Joey very solemnly,
all the time that Joey was looking at her arm.
Now she suddenly laid down her black head upon
Joey's shoulder. "I like you," she said.</p>

<p>Joey kissed the top of the little black head.
"You're a darling! My father was killed by the
Germans&mdash;at least by their being such beasts to
him and all the other wounded men. They
put him in a cattle-truck, and it was all filth,
and they had no water, and when the women on
the way heard they were English they wouldn't
give them any, though they had heaps."</p>

<p>Joey stared through the bars of the grate, her
eyes growing dim. "So father died, after a bit."</p>

<p>"Would you ever do anything for a German&mdash;except
despise him?" another small girl asked
truculently, and Joey answered:</p>

<p>"No, I don't suppose I should."</p>

<p>She scrambled up in a hurry. "Oh, my
hanky's singeing!"</p>

<p>She was only just in time to save it, for the
fire was really very hot. She snatched it from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[Pg 82]</a></span>
the fender and looked it over anxiously to see
if there were any scorched places. No, there were
none; but something rather strange caught her
eyes in one corner; something that came between
the neat red lettering of the Professor's name&mdash;some
tiny marks that stood out oddly in bright
yellow from the dark violet background.</p>

<p>Joey stared at them for a moment in silence,
holding the handkerchief stretched to its widest
in her two hands. They were photographed upon
her mind in that moment before they faded
and disappeared, leaving the red lettering of the
Professor's name alone, and the handkerchief
bone-dry. Curious marks they were too&mdash;marks
that looked like little dots and dashes. Joey
wondered for a second, and then she heard Noreen
calling in the passage:</p>

<p>"Jocelyn! Jocelyn!"</p>

<p>Joey made a dash for the door, pursued by a
chorus of "Come again, come again soon!" In
her hurry, she thought no more about the oddness
of the little marks which appeared with the
heat and disappeared again as quickly. Noreen
sounded good-tempered; perhaps she would return
the handkerchief to the Professor, as Joey
herself was forbidden to go out.</p>

<p>She preferred her request, breathlessly. Noreen
very muddy and dishevelled, answered a
shade doubtfully.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span></p>

<p>"He's always such a foaming-at-the-mouth
sort of beast if you intrude on his blessed privacy.
Still, I don't mind trying if you like. He <em>ought</em>
to be pleased to get back his old hanky. What
am I to say if I see him&mdash;humblest apologies
and all that? Righto! Stay with the kids till
tea: we shan't get a fire till supper-time. If I
don't return, look for me in a poisoned grave
under the Lab."</p>

<p>Noreen departed. Joey went back to the
babies for the ten minutes that remained before
tea-time, and found that they liked stories quite
as much as Kirsty and Bingo did. Then Matron
came in to give them their tea, and Joey went
down to hers.</p>

<p>She did not see Noreen till the meal was over;
but caught her up in the hall&mdash;on the way to the
classrooms for prep.</p>

<p>"So sorry, Jocelyn, after you've washed it
and all, but I let that hanky drop on the way,
and muddied it a little&mdash;not much. So I thought
I'd better not face the Professor, but just
chucked it in at an open window. You bet he'll
see it&mdash;he probably won't know it ever left the
floor where you found it," she said. "So that's
all right, isn't it?"</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully," Joe said, and tried to think
it was as right as Noreen said.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="8">VIII</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Peace-Pipe</small></h2>

<p>Matron was lying in wait at the door of
Remove II. B Classroom, and pounced
on Joey as she came out at the end of prep explaining
that she was to go to bed at once in order
that her throat and chest might be rubbed
with camphorated oil.</p>

<p>Joey submitted, but unwillingly; bed two
hours before anybody else, when she didn't feel
ill, only heavy, was a very depressing idea.
However, it was clearly no case for argument.</p>

<p>Matron bustled her through her bath and into
bed, and was rubbing her with a vigour that left
no breath for conversation on her part by the
time the other three came in to change their
frocks for supper.</p>

<p>Joey wished very heartily that Matron had
finished, for she had thought of some new and
effective things to say to Syb and Barbara, in
answer to their taunts of last night. Noreen was,
of course, to be left out; Noreen had really been
decent about the bed and everything, even if she
had been the ringleader in that ragging business.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>
Joey meant to forgive and forget where Noreen
was concerned; but to let Syb and Barbara have
it hot and strong. Only she would contrive to let
them know that she wouldn't take all the hot
water again.</p>

<p>But of course nothing could be said or done
while Matron was in the room. She had finished
the rubbing now, but was pouring out a portentous
dose of ammoniated quinine. On the other
side of the room Barbara, Syb, and Noreen were
dressing with extraordinary politeness. "Please,
Barbara, could you hook me up?" and so on.
They were nearly ready; if Matron stayed much
longer the supper bell would ring, and the opportunity
would be lost.</p>

<p>Joey gulped the ammoniated quinine with a
haste that brought tears to her eyes; but still
Matron did not go. She was inspecting Joey's
garments with a searching eye to see that she was
wearing enough of them. Noreen, Barbara, and
Syb had reached the hair-ribbon stage before
Matron had finished pointing out the need of another
vest; and she was still mentioning kindly
but firmly that it was generally a girl's own fault
if she caught a cold, when the bell rang, and it
was too late. Joey could almost have cried.</p>

<p>A maid brought her a strictly invalid supper&mdash;a
cup of bread and milk and a spongecake.
Rather unexciting. Joey made it last as long as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span>
possible, but that wasn't very long. Then there
was nothing left to do but wait till the rest came
to bed.</p>

<p>The advantage of having a window bed was
not specially apparent just now, because there
was no moon and the fen-world was quite dark.
Not even the shadowy outline of the high round
tower was to be seen. Joey lay mournfully
in bed, and wished for a book. If the girls
danced again after supper it would be quite nine
o'clock before they came upstairs, and it hadn't
struck eight yet. More than a whole long hour
to wait, doing nothing. And then, just as she
was thinking that, the door of Blue Dorm
opened, and Gabrielle put her head in. Joey
could see her auburn hair against the light in the
passage; the room itself was dark, the maid having
turned off the electric light when she took
the supper tray.</p>

<p>"Are you sleepy, Jocelyn? Or would you like
me to come in and talk?" she asked.</p>

<p>"Oh, do come in&mdash;I'm fearfully tired of bed,"
Joey burst out&mdash;"that is, if you don't want to
be dancing?"</p>

<p>Gabrielle shut the door, and felt her way over
to the one occupied bed.</p>

<p>"I'd rather talk&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Somebody rushed at the door, turned the
handle violently, and dashed in.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p>"Hullo, Jocelyn, ready for some company?"
demanded a cheerful and familiar voice.</p>

<p>Gabrielle switched on the light, and she and
Noreen O'Hara looked at one another.</p>

<p>"Oh&mdash;you've come to sit with Jocelyn, have
you?" Noreen said. "Then I'd better clear out."</p>

<p>"Look here, why shouldn't we both stay?"
suggested Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"Don't know why we shouldn't," Noreen
agreed. "Mind, Jocelyn?"</p>

<p>"Rather not."</p>

<p>"Only, there's one thing I want to say to you
which Gabrielle can't hear&mdash;it isn't my secret,"
Noreen explained hurriedly.</p>

<p>"Shall I get out?" Gabrielle asked.</p>

<p>"No&mdash;stick your fingers in your ears a sec, if
you don't mind."</p>

<p>Gabrielle obliged.</p>

<p>Noreen plumped down on Joey's bed. "It's
this&mdash;Syb and Barbara asked me to tell you
they're sorry they were such beasts to you last
night&mdash;and they think you a sport not to have
let on to Ingrid."</p>

<p>"Did they say that?" gasped Joey.</p>

<p>"Yes, honest injun!"</p>

<p>"Then I shan't be able to say the utterly hateful
things I'd thought of for to-night," Joey
murmured regretfully. "But I <em>was</em> a pig about
the bath-water, wasn't I?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[Pg 88]</a></span></p>

<p>"You were," Noreen agreed, with fervour.</p>

<p>"Then that's all right and square. Please tell
them I'm sorry I took it all."</p>

<p>"Have you finished?" asked Gabrielle tragically.
"It's giving me a pain in both my arms to
keep them up so long."</p>

<p>Noreen pulled her arms down. "It's all right.
We've only been settling to be friends in this
dorm. After all, it <em>is</em> a decent dorm; it was a
pity to fight in it."</p>

<p>"It's got the best places for photos of any,"
Gabrielle said, walking round, and looking at
Joey's collection in a very friendly way. "May
I take them down and look? I say, what a darling
little thing in socks. Is he your brother?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;he's Bingo&mdash;his proper name is Bevil,
but of course we couldn't call him a thing like
that, poor kid," Joey explained, quite cheerfully.
"He is pretty, isn't he? An artist came along
and painted him last year&mdash;and he was in the
Academy. He did him hugging a German
helmet Father brought back&mdash;and just in his
everyday things, so Bingo was pleased. He was
looking up as if someone out of the picture was
telling him something he wasn't going to lose a
word of. The artist put some Latin under the
picture&mdash;it meant 'Our fathers have told us.'"</p>

<p>Noreen had been staring open-mouthed all
through the narrative.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="Illustration_HAVE_YOU_FINISHED_ASKED_GABRIELLE" id="Illustration_HAVE_YOU_FINISHED_ASKED_GABRIELLE"><img src="images/gabrielle.jpg" alt="Gabrielle" width="430" height="663" /></a>
<p class="caption">"HAVE YOU FINISHED?" ASKED GABRIELLE</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span></p>
<p>"But&mdash;but&mdash;you <em>said</em> that the kid was the
gravedigger's youngest," she broke out.</p>

<p>"So I did," Joey agreed calmly.</p>

<p>"And he isn't?"</p>

<p>"Did you suppose all the having on was going
to be upon one side?" Joey inquired succinctly.
"Besides I thought you'd all like it better that
way."</p>

<p>"Then isn't the big one the butcher's boy?"</p>

<p>"No, he's my brother Gavin."</p>

<p>Noreen became rather red. "I say, did you
happen to hear what we said&mdash;in the train?" she
stammered.</p>

<p>"About the village school, and letting down
Redlands by my coming?" Joey answered.
"Yes, I did. I couldn't help it, you did talk so
fearfully loud," she added.</p>

<p>"We didn't mean you to hear," Noreen said
miserably.</p>

<p>Joey grinned. "It doesn't matter if I did. <em>I</em>
don't care. It was a very jolly village school."</p>

<p>"I'm sure it must have been," Noreen said
heartily.</p>

<p>"Look here," interrupted Gabrielle. "What
on earth does it matter what sort of school Jocelyn
went to? It was pretty poor in Redlanders
even to talk as if it mattered."</p>

<p>"It was," owned Noreen, with a meekness that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span>
surprised Joey, considering that she was quite
half a head taller than Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"But Noreen started being awfully decent to
me last night, when she still thought all my photos
were&mdash;what I said they were," Joey chimed
in, in a hurry. "So <em>I</em> don't mind. We went to
the village school because Father died in the
war, you know, and Mums is frightfully poor;
and if the other Redlanders don't like it&mdash;well,
they needn't! But I'm glad to be friends with
Blue Dorm&mdash;at least not enemies, you know&mdash;that
sort of friends."</p>

<p>"I want you to be real friends, Jocelyn&mdash;the
proper kind, if you'll be it with me as well as
Gabrielle," Noreen explained in a hurry. "I
wanted to last night."</p>

<p>"All right," said Joey. "I think I'd like to
be friends too."</p>

<p>"And we must find a name for you," suggested
Gabrielle. "Jocelyn is awfully nice, but
the others will think about you as the scholarship
kid they ragged, if you stick to it; you want
some handy little name&mdash;that will make you seem
like another girl; and we'll all start fresh."</p>

<p>"They call me 'Joey' at home," Joey answered,
after a moment's consideration. She knew there
was a great deal in what Gabrielle said about the
name&mdash;Jocelyn Graham had not made a very
popular start.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[Pg 91]</a></span></p>

<p>"<em>Joey</em>&mdash;top-hole!" Noreen cried. "You're
much more like a boy than a girl; that suits you
down to the ground."</p>

<p>And as 'Joey' she was presented to the rather
embarrassed Syb and Barbara when they came
up to bed, armed with a sticky bag of toffee&mdash;in
large lumps of which luxury the occupants of
Blue Dorm smoked the peace-pipe forthwith.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="9">IX</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">"Maddy"</small></h2>

<p>Remove II. B had French for first lesson
next morning; Joey was informed of the
fact during getting-up-time next morning by an
almost aggressively friendly Sybil, Barbara, and
Noreen.</p>

<p>"Who takes us?" Joey asked, a little nervously.
French was by no means her strong point.</p>

<p>"Maddy, of course&mdash;Mademoiselle de Lavernais."</p>

<p>"What's she like?"</p>

<p>Noreen screwed up her face. "Awfully old
and dried up, and a sort of front thing on her
head in tight curls."</p>

<p>"Can't think why Miss Conyngham doesn't
have somebody younger," Syb chimed in. "No
one else is really old at the Coll. I bet Maddy's
sixty if she's a day."</p>

<p>"More," Barbara suggested. "Look at her
wrinkles. She ought to be pensioned off or something;
I should think she jolly well deserves it&mdash;she's
been here more than twenty years someone
told me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[Pg 93]</a></span></p>

<p>"Is she nice?" asked Joey, thinking anxiously
of irregular verbs and elusive idioms.</p>

<p>"Nice!&mdash;you wait till you go a howler in form!"</p>

<p>"Having me on?" demanded Joey, with instant
suspicion.</p>

<p>"No, you stupid; can't you see when we're talking
sense?" Noreen said. "I ought to know; I'm
always in her black books. She simply can't
bear me."</p>

<p>"Says Noreen doesn't think or something,"
Syb contributed.</p>

<p>"As if anyone could be bothered to think right
through a stuffy French conversation class."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" shrieked Joey. "It isn't French conversation,
is it?"</p>

<p>"Isn't it just?&mdash;Maddy says heaps of girls
can write French decently, but hardly anyone
can speak it; so every Wednesday morning Remove
II. B has the treat&mdash;I don't think!&mdash;of
conversing with her in French, and you mayn't
just say, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il pluit</i>,' or something like that, and
then dry up; you've got to converse, and she
goes on till she drags it out of you."</p>

<p>"Does everyone?" asked Joey, palpitating.</p>

<p>"She picks the girls. Pretty sure to go for
you as you're new. She'll want to know what
your French is like."</p>

<p>"She won't take long to find out that it's utterly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[Pg 94]</a></span>
hopeless," Joey remarked, hunting for her
shoes, which had gone under the bed.</p>

<p>"I say! wouldn't it be rather a rag to put
Jocelyn&mdash;Joey, I mean&mdash;up to some perfectly
awful French that would take half the lesson to
correct?" suggested Noreen, of the fertile brain.
"Then <em>we'd</em> get a rest."</p>

<p>"Brainy plan," approved Barbara. "But
would you mind, Joey? You can't get into a
row, you see, because she can't know if you really
know any French or not; she'll only just point
out to you where you're wrong, in the kind of
tone which implies that they wouldn't keep idiots
of your kind in France at any price, and you'll
have to say, '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Merci bien</i>,' or is it '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Beaucoup</i>'?&mdash;I
never can remember which&mdash;and '<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je comprends</i>',
or is it <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">'C'est comprenn&eacute;?'</i>&mdash;one <em>does</em> get
out in the hols!&mdash;at proper intervals, and look intelligent&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Never mind if it's a bit of a strain," Noreen
contributed, and Joey, having a shoe all ready
in her hand, not unnaturally hurled it at the
speaker. Noreen dodged, and it got the window,
and made a huge star.</p>

<p>"My Sunday hat and Dublin Castle!" Noreen
exclaimed, craning round from her seat on the
bed to examine the mischief. "You've gone and
done it now, Joey&mdash;at least it was most my fault
really. I'll tell Matron that."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p>"Rot! I threw the shoe," Joey said, rather
dismayed. "I don't mind about Matron; she
can't do much worse than the ghastly stuff she's
been giving me&mdash;at least I hope she doesn't stop
the beastly window out of my pocket-money?"</p>

<p>"No; they don't do that sort of thing here,"
Noreen said. "They just hold forth, and tell
you carelessness is a sort of dishonesty and that
sort of thing. You'll have to say you're sorry."</p>

<p>"Well, I am."</p>

<p>"And Matron will point out you've behaved
like a kindergarten kid, and if she were Tiddles
she wouldn't be surprised at your wanting to
throw your shoes about. Comprenny?"</p>

<p>"Righto&mdash;I shall stick it," Joey assured her.</p>

<p>"They don't nag here&mdash;much," added the experienced
Noreen for her comfort; "when you've
been jawed or punished or both, it's over and
done with. What about the French? Think
you could do anything?"</p>

<p>"I might try," Joey said, with caution.</p>

<p>"But there won't be time now to put her up
to it all," objected Barbara. "Why didn't we
think of it earlier?"</p>

<p>"Why not let Joey, as she's new, try it on
some other way?" put in Noreen. "Ask Maddy
something that means a long screed in answer.
Oh yes, I know she squashed me flat for doing
it, but that was ages back, and she knew me and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
my reputation. Now here's a nice, innocent, and
probably good, new girl."</p>

<p>"Don't call me names!" interrupted Joey.</p>

<p>"I said <em>probably</em>; well, try and turn Maddy
on, in all innocence and ignorance, my child, and
the Form will love you for evermore. We are
always absolutely stuck for subjects the first
French day of term."</p>

<p>The prayer-bell rang insistently. "What
would she <em>like</em> to talk about, do you think?" asked
Joey desperately, catching at Noreen's sleeve;
"the War?"</p>

<p>"Try the Franco-German affair; she was probably
a blushing thing in a crinoline about that
time&mdash;she'll enjoy telling us about it if we can
only get her started."</p>

<p>"I'll try," Joey said valiantly and breathlessly
upon the stairs, and she worried out the
French for her request during breakfast.</p>

<p>Maddy met Remove II. B at nine o'clock
precisely. Joey watched her mount the da&iuml;s with
a sinking heart. She was a little lady, who made
no pretence of being anything but elderly, with
a dried-up skin that pouched under her black
eyes, and the rather dusty "front" upon which
the girls had commented did not match the hair
at the back of her small well-set head. She was
shabbily dressed, and all the little air of distinction
with which she wore her clothes could not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[Pg 97]</a></span>
make them becoming. Joey decided that she
should not like Mademoiselle de Lavernais.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle wasted no time in preliminaries.
She said "Good-morning" to her class in clear,
ringing accents, and they responded very properly.
Then the real business began. In rapid
French she mentioned that she hoped to hear
much interesting conversation from the Form
this morning, and&mdash;"Barbara, we should all like
to learn your opinion on the Channel Tunnel."</p>

<p>Barbara became pink. "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je crois&mdash;bien&mdash;que
c'est une bonne chose pour lesquels qui souffre
de mal de mer</span>," she blundered unhappily.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle threw up her hands in horror.</p>

<p>"Is it that I am taking the babies of the kindergarten?"
she inquired. "How often am I to
tell you that you nefare, <em>nefare</em> translate literally
from the English idiom to the French. Noreen,
let me hear you."</p>

<p>Noreen cast an agonised appeal on Joey.
"What I think about the Channel Tunnel,
Mademoiselle?" she asked.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">En Fran&ccedil;ais, si'l vous pla&icirc;t, mon enfant.</span>"</p>

<p>Noreen stared wildly around her for inspiration.
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je pense</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">je pense</span>&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Continuez</span>," said Mademoiselle inexorably.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je pense</span>&mdash;<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">que je n'ai pas des pens&eacute;es sur le
sujet</span>&mdash;encore," poor Noreen informed her miserably.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">[Pg 98]</a></span></p>

<p>"Fourteen years old, and without a thought
on a subject so concerning the welfare of your
great nation," Mademoiselle said, with slow
scorn. "It is a pity almost that you have a
nation, Noreen. You should belong to some
miserable little German State, where la patrie
is represented by the gendarme with his big fist,
and the tax-collector. Find another subject that
you can talk of&mdash;some of those that figure in the
paper during your silly season will suit you well,
I make no doubt."</p>

<p>Noreen, scarlet about the ears, was obviously
unable to find a subject at all. Perhaps it was
not wonderful! Joey, burning with resentment
for her friend, rushed into the breach.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il serait tres</span>"&mdash;she tried to think of the
word for improving, but failing to see even a
glimpse of it, unfortunately substituted "<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amusante</i>,
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">si vous voulez dire &aacute; nous l'histoire d'une
chose ou deux que vous avez vue pendant la
guerre de soixante-dix quand les allemands et
les fran&ccedil;ais</span>...."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle swung round upon the da&iuml;s and
looked hard at Joey, standing up in her place,
rather frightened and very floundering about
the French, but sturdily determined to go
through with the business she had undertaken.
Mademoiselle heard her out, with no comment
bad or good till she reached the word "<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">fran&ccedil;ais</span>,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span>
then suddenly her heavy black eyes gave a great
flash.</p>

<p>"You are, I think, a new girl, and therefore
scarcely know, perhaps, how great an impertinence
you commit," she said very quietly, but in
a voice that was more dreadful than if she had
screamed. "But any girl that is worthy of the
name of English should understand that to ask
a Frenchwoman, who has seen and remembers,
to <em>amuse</em> her with stories of the time when France
was trodden in the dust by <em>swine</em>, is to make
an insult that can nefare be forgotten. Leave
the classroom; I will not teach such a girl. Sybil,
impart to me your views on the best length for
summer holidays&mdash;perhaps that will not be beyond
your range of intellect."</p>

<p>Joey heard no more; somehow she reached the
door and stumbled out, feeling so indelibly disgraced
that she had serious thoughts of taking
the next train home. Now she came to think about
it, it <em>was</em> a hopeless thing that she had said; how
would she have liked it if the girls had asked her,
Joey, to tell them a funny story about prisoners
of war in German hands. Of course they were
the same Germans&mdash;at least the fathers of the
horrible Huns who had tortured the wounded
and prisoners, and hurt little children like Tiddles.
And Joey had used that word <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">amusante</i>,
when Mademoiselle remembered things&mdash;perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
as bad as the things which Mums had never
wished the children to read in the newspapers.</p>

<p>"If I knew more French I shouldn't have put
it so <em>horribly</em>," poor Joey said to herself; but it
didn't occur to her to blame Noreen and Syb
and Barbara who had suggested this unfortunate
plan in the first instance. She wandered up
and down the passage in a kind of frenzy; she
would have to go home, but honour demanded
one should first wipe the floor with oneself before
the outraged Maddy.</p>

<p>Joey thought no French lesson could ever have
been half so long; she couldn't go away from that
rather dreary and viewless passage, because she
might miss Maddy when she came out. The temporary
mistress who was taking Miss Craigie's
place would go to the classroom as soon as Maddy
had finished; that was all Joey knew.</p>

<p>At last there were steps along the passage,
but it was the Senior Prefect who came in sight.
She had a little three-cornered note in her hand,
and was evidently in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Is Mademoiselle still with Remove II. B?"
she asked briskly, and then as Joey murmured
"Yes," she looked at her.</p>

<p>"It's the scholarship kid, isn't it? But why
aren't you in class?"</p>

<p>"I was turned out," Joey mentioned in a low
voice.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[Pg 101]</a></span></p>

<p>"Then you must have been behaving like a
young silly," Ingrid told her crushingly; and
then perhaps she saw the utter misery in Joey's
face.</p>

<p>"But there's no need to be so tragic about it&mdash;do
you suppose you're the only girl who has
ever been turned out of a classroom? Tell
Mademoiselle you're sorry and won't do it again&mdash;and
don't do it again, that's all!"</p>

<p>With which excellent advice the Senior Prefect
knocked at the classroom door, and went in with
her note, leaving Joey outside to wonder miserably
if Ingrid would condescend to speak to her
at all if she knew.</p>

<p>Ingrid came out, and passed Joey with a good-natured
nod. A minute later there were other
steps in the passage, and the temporary mathematical
mistress, rather blown about from a long
bicycle ride on a windy day, hurried down towards
the classroom, nervously afraid of being
late.</p>

<p>"Do you know whether Mademoiselle de
Lavernais has come out yet?" she asked.</p>

<p>"No, she hasn't."</p>

<p>"Are you waiting for my class? Are you in
Remove II. B by the way?" the mistress said.</p>

<p>Joey foresaw rocks and shoals. "I'm so new
I don't know what I'm to take and what I'm
not," she temporised.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span></p>

<p>"Well, come in with me and we'll see. The
other girls will know," suggested the mistress.
She laid a friendly hand on Joey's shoulder.
Joey wriggled away, with a deplorable lack of
manners, and bolted up the passage, as far as
the row of little music-rooms, with their double
doors. She couldn't let herself be dragged into
a maths class without at least trying to make
Mademoiselle see that she had not meant to be
as horribly unfeeling as she had sounded.</p>

<p>A door opened and shut: steps&mdash;rather tired,
halting steps&mdash;came towards her. Joey screwed
up her courage, and made a desperate plunge in
the direction of the small, black, shapeless figure
advancing towards her reading a note.</p>

<p>"Do you mind if I say it in English, because
it is frightfully hard to say what you want in
French," she blurted out. "I know I was unspeakable,
but I didn't mean it truly, and I
couldn't think of any French word except <em>amusante</em>,
truthfully&mdash;French <em>is</em> such a slippy language
when you're trying to talk. I didn't mean
the Franco-German business could be funny&mdash;and
my Father was killed in this war!"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Lavernais had stopped reading
her note when Joey began to speak, but she
said nothing at all till Joey had finished. Her
black eyes were fixed unwaveringly on Joey's
face, so fixedly that Joey wondered vaguely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
through all her misery if she had an ink smudge
there.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle suddenly laid a hand on her
shoulder, and drew her into one of the little
music-rooms.</p>

<p>"For me perhaps also the words I used said
what I did not altogether mean," she said slowly,
"though I have not your excuse, my child, of
finding your language 'slippy,' having been in
this country since I was more young than you. I
think I was not just to say you were not English,
because you did not understand."</p>

<p>"Thank you awfully," Joey murmured.</p>

<p>"And your father has died for his country?"
Mademoiselle went on. "Mine died when I was
more young than you, but that was of a broken
heart."</p>

<p>"Because of the Germans winning?" Joey ventured.</p>

<p>"My home was in Alsace," said Mademoiselle.
"You&mdash;how would you have felt if the great
Foch, the great Haig, and the great Americans
had <em>not</em> conquered with the help of God, and
your home had been handed over to the Hun."</p>

<p>"I don't know," Joey said. It was unthinkable.</p>

<p>"You don't know; you are fortunate. I had
to know. But that is over, thank God; we have
waited almost fifty years, but it is over."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span></p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Lavernais seemed to have
forgotten her, Joey thought; her dull black eyes
had lit up&mdash;her plain, tired face was quite transformed.
Joey wondered whether she ought to
slip out and go to the maths mistress&mdash;another
apology would certainly be needed there. Fortunately,
Mademoiselle came back to earth in a
minute. "But what do I talk of? We should
both be at our classrooms, you, I fear, will be in
trouble in that you are late. My class will merely
rejoice that cross old Maddy has given them a
little longer of liberty to chatter in English.
Should you not be at mathematics? Come with
me."</p>

<p>She put her hand again on Joey's shoulder,
and they went down the passage to Classroom
Remove II. B together. Mademoiselle knocked
and went in.</p>

<p>"Miss Musgrave, you will of your kindness,
I hope, forgive the lateness of this pupil, who
was detained by me not by her fault," she said.
"The blame is all mine; I make you the apologies."</p>

<p>"Oh, of course; that is all right, Mademoiselle,"
Miss Musgrave said nervously. "Take
your place, please; what is your name?"</p>

<p>"Jocelyn."</p>

<p>"Take your place, Jocelyn."</p>

<p>Joey couldn't thank Mademoiselle in the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[Pg 105]</a></span>
of a class, but the look she gave her was eloquent
enough. Mademoiselle smiled back, before
she bowed to Miss Musgrave and departed to her
own class.</p>

<p>Remove II. B discussed the extraordinary incident
of that smile all through the interval for
milk and buns, three-quarters of an hour later.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="10">X</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">A Sunday Out</small></h2>

<p>Cousin Greta was as good or as bad
as her word; Joey wasn't quite sure which
way to look at it. On that first Sunday morning,
while she, with the twenty other girls at Miss
Lambton's table, was enjoying the Sunday luxury
of late breakfast and hot sausages, a note was
brought to Miss Lambton.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn Graham," she called.</p>

<p>Joey stood up.</p>

<p>"Miss Conyngham has sent to say that relations
are coming to take you out. They will
be here at 12.30. Go to the drawing-room when
you come out of chapel."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Lambton."</p>

<p>Joey sat down, and went on with her sausages.
She felt rather depressed; the only cheering part
of the business was that by going out she would
probably escape that unknown horror of saying
her Collect, Epistle, and Gospel, and being questioned
on them.</p>

<p>Noreen was sitting two places away. "What
are they? Aunts, uncles, or what? Are they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span>
good for chocolates, or will they point out that
those are still four shillings a pound, and schoolgirls
should be thankful for bread and margarine!"</p>

<p>"I expect the relation is my Cousin Greta, and
she always used to bring us chocolates," Joey
answered.</p>

<p>"Don't eat them all on the way home. Think
of your precious health, my che-ild," cried half
a dozen imploring voices.</p>

<p>Joey could take chaff better now; besides, the
antipathy of the Redlanders to her village school
had died a natural and speedy death.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps I'd better think of yours," she said.</p>

<p>"You little beast!" muttered Noreen, but rather
inaudibly, "beast" being one of the expressions
that even easy-going Miss Lambton did
not pass at table.</p>

<p>There was a walk before chapel on Sundays,
if weather allowed; Joey paired off with Gabrielle
on this occasion, and found her sympathetic
over the outing.</p>

<p>"It's always decent going out when you're at
school, even if it's to the stuffiest people," she
explained. "It's different, you know&mdash;that's it
partly. There was a girl here&mdash;she's left now&mdash;whose
only relation handy was a great-aunt who
was quite deaf and almost blind, and rather childish
too, poor thing. And there was nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
whatever for Chrissie to do at her house but play
with the cat, and no books except <em>Laneton Parsonage</em>
and <em>The Fairchild Family</em>. But Chrissie
liked going all the same; you see, she could tell
the other girls she had a good time when she
came back, and that was something."</p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose that would be something,"
Joey agreed, and went to get ready for chapel
in much better spirits.</p>

<p>Redlands Chapel was very beautiful. Later
on Joey came to know much of its story: that
the wonderful black chancel screen had been rescued
by a girl's father from an old barn on his
estate, and went back to the stormy times of Henry
<span class="small-caps lowercase">VIII.</span>'s devastating war upon the monasteries;
that the beautiful reredos had been carved by an
old pupil of the College who had gone out into
the world to find fame. Three of the windows
came from a little private chapel near by, and
had suffered at the hands of Cromwell's Fifth
Monarchy men.</p>

<p>She stood and knelt in her place about half-way
down the aisle, feeling it all very strange
after the plain little "Established" service at
Calgarloch, where Mr. Craigie preached for an
hour on end, and brought sweeties to Kirsty and
Bingo in the afternoon if they had not fidgeted.</p>

<p>Joey liked the service, though she didn't know
what singing could be till the second hymn; the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span>
College always refusing to throw any enthusiasm
into the strains of</p>

<div class="poetry-container">
  <div class="poetry">
    <div class="stanza">
      <div class="verse">Lord, behold us with Thy blessing,</div>
      <div class="verse">Once again assembled here.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p>But with the second&mdash;"Onward! Christian
Soldiers," the six hundred Redlanders fairly let
go, swamping choir and organ. Joey found that
she enjoyed that hymn. It is a wonderful
feeling to join in with that crowd. She forgot
that she had been rather lonely, in a pew full
of strangers, with Gabrielle and Noreen both
far away from her in the choir.</p>

<p>When the service was over she went, as ordered,
straight to Miss Conyngham's room, where
she found Cousin Greta&mdash;tall, thin, grey-haired,
and distinguished-looking&mdash;conversing with Miss
Conyngham.</p>

<p>Joey offered a cheek to her relative with exemplary
politeness. Cousin Greta kissed her and
then held her at arm's length, looking at her
critically.</p>

<p>"My dear child, what a beanstalk for only
thirteen! But height runs in the family," she
added to Miss Conyngham; "my cousin, this
child's father, was six foot two."</p>

<p>"Mums is tall as well," Joey put in aggressively.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span></p>

<p>"Yes, I suppose she is," agreed Cousin Greta,
without interest. "Are you ready to come, Joey?
I will bring her back&mdash;did you say in time for
evening chapel&mdash;6.30? Very good, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>Cousin Greta and the Head shook hands, and
Cousin Greta laid beautifully gloved fingers on
Joey's shoulders, and walked her out in the wake
of the perfect parlour-maid to the front door,
where her Daimler was waiting.</p>

<p>Joey tried to look riotously happy, not so
much, it is to be feared, from motives of politeness,
as because she wanted to impress the other
girls standing about in little groups near the
entrance. She even waved condescendingly to
one of the two big girls who had sat beside her
at that first breakfast and taken so little notice
of her presence. The senior tried to put her in
her place by not returning the wave, but Joey
knew they were envious, all the same. Of course,
they couldn't know what a stupid sort of outing
she was really going to have.</p>

<p>"And how do you like Redlands?" asked
Cousin Greta, as the car slid smoothly down the
drive.</p>

<p>"Oh, all right," Joey answered, still with caution.</p>

<p>"Have you made many friends yet?"</p>

<p>"Not whole ones&mdash;sort of half."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span></p>

<p>"What <em>do</em> you mean?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I like some of the girls," Joey said, getting
red; "but that isn't being proper friends,
is it?"</p>

<p>Cousin Greta "didn't know." Joey thought
she had been an idiot to try and answer that
question so truthfully. She might have realised
that Cousin Greta wouldn't be likely to understand,
and for the next ten minutes she patiently
answered questions as to the health of Mums, the
boys, and Kirsty, her own place in Form, and
such-like. She also told Cousin Greta all that
she thought Cousin Greta would like to know:
what his late Headmaster had said about Gavin;
the good place Ronnie had taken; Bingo's funny
comment when the schoolmaster tried to teach
him the first declension.</p>

<p>"I'm sure God didn't make this language the
same time as He made nice fings like elephants."</p>

<p>"Your father's boys would have brains," said
Cousin Greta approvingly.</p>

<p>"Father always said Mums had twice his,"
Joey fired out, getting hot and angry.</p>

<p>"Your father was very modest," Cousin Greta
said, but she sighed. It occurred to Joey that
perhaps Cousin Greta disliked the day together
quite as much as she herself did. She made an
effort to be pleasant; perhaps, after all, Cousin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span>
Greta didn't mean to slight Mums; it was only
her stupid way of talking.</p>

<p>"Do tell me about Father when he was a little
boy," she asked.</p>

<p>"If you peep at the glass in my room when we
come to Mote House you will know just what he
looked like," Lady Greta told her more cheerfully.</p>

<p>Joey stared. "Am I like him? I never knew
that."</p>

<p>"I see the likeness," Cousin Greta said, and
was silent for a little while the car flew along
the straight marsh road at a most exhilarating
pace.</p>

<p>"I suppose your mother never heard anything
more after the letter from that fellow-prisoner,
which she sent me?" she asked at last.</p>

<p>"No, nothing; though Mums wrote and wrote,
and went to meet the batch of prisoners from
Wilhelmgradt after the Armistice, and Uncle
Staff went on going to the War Office."</p>

<p>"It was a great blow to us all," said Lady
Greta.</p>

<p>Joey bit back the remark that it was worst for
Mums; after all, Mums wouldn't have liked her
to say it. There was a little silence.</p>

<p>"Gracie is looking forward to seeing you,"
Cousin Greta went on at last. "Let me see, she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
is just two years older than you are, I suppose."</p>

<p>"She doesn't go to school, does she?"</p>

<p>"No, I am afraid I am not quite a believer in
school for girls. Besides, she has such a delightful
governess, Miss Richards."</p>

<p>Joey supposed "How nice for her" was the
proper thing to say, and said it; and that remark
brought them to Mote Court.</p>

<p>Gracie met them at the door, a pretty but
delicate-looking girl, very beautifully dressed.
When Joey shook hands with her she suddenly
realised that her own stockings were darned in
the leg, where the darn showed a good deal.</p>

<p>However, Gracie was quite polite, and carried
her guest off to her own room to take off her
coat and hat and wash her hands for luncheon,
and then to the schoolroom, where Miss Richards
was sitting, playing Halma with a spare, freckled
boy who was lying on the sofa, covered with a
rug.</p>

<p>Gracie introduced Miss Richards, and then the
boy as "My Cousin John."</p>

<p>Joey liked the look of John, though his best
friends couldn't have called him anything but
plain. But he had a pleasant and companionable
grin, and a much more vigorous way of shaking
hands than either Gracie or Miss Richards.</p>

<p>"We had better put away the Halma men,
John," said Miss Richards. "The luncheon gong<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>
will go directly, and you will like to talk to
Gracie's little friend."</p>

<p>Joey wriggled inwardly at this description, but
went and sat down by John's sofa. Anyhow, he
looked easier to talk to than Gracie. "I didn't
know you lived here," she said.</p>

<p>"I don't," John told her. "But I had a smash-up,
you see, and Aunt Greta asked me here to
get fit again!"</p>

<p>"John is in the Navy," Gracie explained.
"He's a middy on the ..."</p>

<p>"A snotty," corrected John in a warning
growl. "You're at school here, aren't you?" he
added, turning to Joey.</p>

<p>"I'm at Redlands."</p>

<p>"That's the big place out beyond the Round
Tower?"</p>

<p>"Yes. I say, do you know anything about the
tower?" Joey asked breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Aunt Greta's the one to ask&mdash;she lives here.
Why? Are you specially keen on towers?"</p>

<p>"Joey comes from Scotland," Gracie said, as
though a tower were an unknown spectacle in
the north.</p>

<p>Joey was just going to explain that what specially
interested her was not so much the tower
as the queer lights that came from it, when the
gong for luncheon sounded with a roar, and
Gracie got up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[Pg 115]</a></span></p>

<p>"Come along, Joey. John has his lunch up
here."</p>

<p>Rather dull for John, Joey thought, as she
followed her cousin obediently along corridors
and downstairs to the dining-room. She would
have liked to ask about him, and whether he
would soon be better, but was afraid of seeming
inquisitive, so left Gracie and Miss Richards to
make polite conversation.</p>

<p>In the dining-room she was presented to
Colonel Sturt, who was bald and rather morose,
and gave her two fingers only when she shook
hands. Then Cousin Greta motioned Joey to
a chair on her own right, and luncheon began.</p>

<p>It was a very grand luncheon; mindful of what
Gabrielle had said, Joey stored up an exact description
of the mayonnaise and roast chickens,
the cold sirloin and wonderful salad, the trifle,
meringues and apricot-jam tartlets; they at least
would be something to tell the girls about.</p>

<p>Cousin Greta saw to it that Joey made an excellent
meal, but it was certainly a dull one.
Colonel Sturt was upset by something he had
read in his paper about Germans creeping back
into the country; and Gracie was almost as obviously
annoyed by her mother's refusal to let
her do something or other that she wanted that
afternoon. She did talk to Joey a little, but the
two years between them seemed to make an impossible<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">[Pg 116]</a></span>
gulf, Joey thought. It was really rather
a comfort when the long, grand luncheon was
over, even though Cousin Greta swept Joey off
to her own room for "a little talk"&mdash;rather an
alarming suggestion.</p>

<p>Cousin Greta's room was a world of looking-glasses;
Joey saw her own slim self reflected
everywhere&mdash;a self who looked oddly spruce and
tidy in the dark green velveteen best frock of
Redlands, and with her mass of fair hair tied
neatly back with a dark green bow. Her brown
eyes under black lashes looked rather seriously
back at this new tidy self reflected.</p>

<p>Cousin Greta came behind Joey and laid two
hands on her shoulders.</p>

<p>"And now, barring the clothes, you know how
your dear father used to look when he came to
us for his holidays," she said, and Joey felt sorry
for Cousin Greta suddenly, and as though she
were minding a good deal about Father under
all her cold, languid ways.</p>

<p>"I'm glad I'm like," she said, "though he
wanted us all to be like Mums. But I'll never
be anything like him in splendidness, worse luck;
now the war is over, there isn't even a chance of
serving your country."</p>

<p>Cousin Greta shivered. "My dear child, don't
talk as though you were sorry this ghastly war
is over!" which was one of the speeches that set<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
Joey's teeth on edge, and were impossible to
answer.</p>

<p>She said no more, and Cousin Greta took a
tremendous box of chocolates from the chest of
drawers and told Joey she was to take them back
with her to school. Then she mentioned that she
always rested for an hour after luncheon, and did
Joey think she could find her way back to the
schoolroom, where she would find Gracie? Joey
thanked Cousin Greta, and was sure she could,
and in due course, and after taking two or three
wrong turnings, she found herself back at the
schoolroom door.</p>

<p>She heard no sound of voices; it did not sound
as though anybody were inside, and sure enough
when she opened the door she found nobody in
the room but John.</p>

<p>He grinned at her in a friendly fashion.
"Where's Gracie?" he asked.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Joey said. She took some
credit to herself for not adding, "I don't care."</p>

<p>John laughed. "Well, come and talk to me
till she comes along."</p>

<p>Joey established herself on a chair by his sofa.
"What do you do when you're a snotty?" she
asked. "We know more about the Army, you
see."</p>

<p>"Keep a look out when the deck's all ice,
mostly," John said. "Of course, sometimes there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[Pg 118]</a></span>
was a scrap&mdash;not half often enough, though&mdash;and
when you get your signal you've to be jolly
quick or the other chap snaffles it all!"</p>

<p>"How do you signal?" Joey asked.</p>

<p>"Wireless mostly. Of course you have to
know all kinds of signals. Can you read Morse?"</p>

<p>"No, I can't."</p>

<p>"I'll teach you&mdash;it's as easy as winking."</p>

<p>And John kept his word. Joey was fairly safe
on the Morse alphabet in half an hour, and felt
immensely pleased with herself. She was only
too delighted that Gracie stayed away so long;
she was beginning to enjoy herself for the first
time that day.</p>

<p>John directed her to a table-drawer, where
there was an electric torch and a whistle; he took
the torch and she the whistle; and she went over
to the window to make her first attempt at "sending"
in Morse. She boggled rather over it, and
had to be prompted in two or three letters; but
John was encouraging, and assured her she was
picking it up very quickly. Then he proceeded
to reply, very slowly, with long and short flashes
from the electric torch. Directly he began Joey
knew of what it reminded her&mdash;the curious blue
flashes she had seen from the leads on that first
night she was at school.</p>

<p>She meant to ask John about them after he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span>
had finished his Morse sentence&mdash;just now that
needed all her concentration.</p>

<p>"Long, short, long, short," she spelt out. "C&mdash;is
that right, John? Short&mdash;long&mdash;don't tell me!
I know. A&mdash;long&mdash;short&mdash;oh, that's the opposite!&mdash;don't
tell me&mdash;N."</p>

<p>"Right&mdash;group," said John. "Ready for next
word?"</p>

<p>He flashed, "Short, long&mdash;long&mdash;long," Joey
almost shrieked in her excitement. It was a letter
like that she had seen in the rainy darkness
from the leads.</p>

<p>"J," she spelt, and then she felt she must tell
John about that light without waiting for the
slow, laborious spelling out of the next word.
She was just going to speak, but she had to see
what the next letter was, and in that instant she
was seeing, Gracie spoke under the widely
opened window. Gracie's voice was very clear,
and every syllable came quite distinctly up to
Joey at the window.</p>

<p>"Yes; I'm awfully annoyed about it, Eleanor,
but I can't get mother to see reason. I suppose
she feels she ought to be nice to this child, who is
a sort of cousin; but it couldn't have hurt her to
go back an hour or two earlier and leave the car
free for me, at the time I want it. As it is,
mother says she isn't going to send the little nuisance
back till half-past six."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[Pg 120]</a></span></p>

<p>"What a shame! I should strike at small
schoolgirl cousins who have to be kept all day,
and sent back in the car."</p>

<p>That was another voice, evidently the voice of
the girl to whom Gracie was talking. Joey forgot
all about Morse, and faced John with hot
cheeks.</p>

<p>"I won't do any more signalling, I think;
thanks no end for teaching me," she said. "I'll
go and find Miss Richards, or someone."</p>

<p>John held out a thin, scarred hand. "I say,
don't you worry about Gracie," he growled.
"Shocking bad form to talk like that, but she
doesn't mean it."</p>

<p>"I don't want to be sent back in the car," poor
Joey burst out. "It's only six miles&mdash;who wants
a car?"</p>

<p>She stopped. It wasn't possible to tell John,
who was Gracie's cousin, that what hurt so much
in the speech was the sense that they all thought
her a nuisance who must be entertained as a duty.
Perhaps John had really been finding her a nuisance
too, when he taught her signalling. Joey's
one thought was to get away from all.</p>

<p>"Thanks awfully for being so nice to me," she
said, "but I'll go now, if you don't mind."</p>

<p>"Here, wait a bit," John urged; but Joey was
already through the door and out in the passage.
She would say good-bye and thank you to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>
Cousin Greta, and ask if she might walk home,
as it was such a lovely afternoon.</p>

<p>But then poor Joey remembered that Cousin
Greta was lying down and must not be disturbed.
What could she do?</p>

<p>Joey suddenly entertained the quite reprehensible
idea of saying nothing to anybody, but
walking home all by herself.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="11">XI</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Sea-Roke</small></h2>

<p>It was all quite easy. She had taken off her
coat and hat in Gracie's room; Joey made her
way there&mdash;hurried into her things, and ran
downstairs. She only met one servant; the place
was in a dozy, Sunday-afternoon condition. She
got out at a side door, and, avoiding the front
drive, where she thought she might be seen and
stopped, she darted away over well-kept lawns,
crossed the ha-ha at a jump, and landed in the
park. Here she slightly slackened her headlong
pace&mdash;nobody would see her among the trees&mdash;and
began to compose her letter of apology to
Cousin Greta. She supposed she was being
dreadfully rude, and it was a rudeness which
would be horribly difficult to explain, without
complaining of Gracie&mdash;naturally an unspeakable
idea.</p>

<p>She had only got as far as "Dear Cousin
Greta,&mdash;I hope I was not very rude, but ..."
when she cleared the park, and crossed the
straight marsh road. She had decided to go by
the fields, in case somebody should be sent after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
her. If she kept in a line with the road, even at
a distance of half a mile or so on the sea-ward
side, she would be quite safe, she thought. She
gave a glance around her to make sure of the
lie of the land; it was all quite easy, for the October
afternoon was clear, and a peculiar transparent
luminosity lay on the glittering horizon.
Then she plunged forward, concocting her letter
to Cousin Greta as she went. It must certainly
be written and sent off to-night, for there was no
question about it, she had been disgracefully
rude. Only she couldn't go on being a nuisance
to people who didn't want her and invited her
out only from a sense of duty.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"<span class="small-caps">Dear Cousin Greta</span>,&mdash;I hope I was not
very rude, but I found I had to get back earlier
than I expected, and ... and ... I didn't
want to disturb you as you were lying down."</p>

</blockquote>

<p>Joey didn't know that in the struggle to compose
that difficult letter of apology to Cousin
Greta she had diverged a little from the straight
line that she had fixed for herself, and was bearing
down farther from the road with every step
she took. The letter took a great deal of pumping
out; one had to try and be truthful, and at
the same time no telltale. When politeness had
to come in as well, it made each sentence most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span>
terribly difficult, and Joey wrestled with that
letter in much affliction of spirit, and went farther
and farther out of her way without ever seeing
where she was going.</p>

<p>The bit about not wanting to disturb Cousin
Greta was not absolutely true, because Joey had
been really glad she had been lying down; still,
perhaps it might pass&mdash;one couldn't say one was
glad anyway.</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"It was very kind of you to have me out,"
Joe went on; "thank you most awfully. About
my going back to Redlands alone. I always go
about alone at home, unless one of the others
happens to be with me, so I hope you won't mind
that. I'm not a kid, you know.</p>

<p class="signed">
"Your affectionate cousin,<br />
"<span class="small-caps">Joey</span>."<br />
</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Joey finished the letter in her mind, and said
it over to herself. It wouldn't take long to write
down, that was one comfort&mdash;and she hoped it
would make Cousin Greta understand she wasn't
quite the ill-mannered girl she had seemed. And
as she finished saying it and got it finally off her
chest, she knew suddenly that she was very cold,
and that a clammy white wall was surrounding
her on every side, that beneath her feet was green
bogginess, and of the road or any landmark there
was not so much as a trace.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span></p>

<p>Joey had heard of the sea-roke in books, but
that didn't make her very clear about it now she
met it. She couldn't think how such a thick,
dead-white fog could have come up without her
noticing it; but here it was, that was very certain.
She began to wish that she had kept to
the high road, or left the composition of that
difficult letter till she got back to Redlands.
However, the roke was here, and she was on the
Deeps and not the road; there was nothing for it
but to keep as straight on as possible&mdash;or better
still, turn to her left and strike the road.</p>

<p>Joey settled that would be the wisest thing to
do, even if it took her out of her way at first; she
turned to the left and went as straight as she
could.</p>

<p>The road seemed to take a very long time to be
reached; Joey couldn't think how she could have
come so far from it. She stumbled on and on,
finding the ground very quaggy, and walking
exceedingly difficult. And then she jumped back
only just in time, for she had all but walked into
one of those deep ditches with slanting sides that
drain the Deeps at intervals, and are a very real
danger, with their thick ooze of mud below the
water, and their slippery banks. Joey knew that
she had crossed no ditch on her way down from
the road; she began to feel a little pricking of
uneasiness. She was very, very tired; her legs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span>
ached, and she seemed to herself to have walked
miles and miles through this cold, clammy, white
wall. And if she couldn't strike the road; how
much farther might she not have to go? And
was all this struggling getting her any nearer to
Redlands?</p>

<p>Joey was not a nervous person, but she sat
down at the side of the dyke to try and get her
bearings, with rather a sinking heart. She had
just remembered that in a fog you tend to wander
in a circle; could she have been doing that all
this long time when she hoped that she was at
least getting on a little?</p>

<p>"What a bally nuisance!" she said aloud. Of
course one couldn't acknowledge, even to oneself,
that it was anything worse than that.</p>

<p>"I suppose I had better wait till the fog lifts,"
she said, wondering whether it were the close,
white wall or the sinking sensation under her
belt that made her voice so hollow. And just as
she said it there came a little breeze, and the roke
lifted for a minute, hanging around like cotton-wool
clouds that wanted to settle on the earth
and couldn't quite make up their minds to do so;
and Joey saw, some thirty yards away from her&mdash;not
the road&mdash;there was no sign of that&mdash;but
a narrow plank bridge that crossed the dyke and,
straight in a line with it, the mysterious Round
Tower.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span></p>

<p>Joey did not waste a minute. She ran for her
life, and was over the bridge before the roke came
down again&mdash;baffling, clinging, frightening. But
the tower was so near, and there was no dyke between;
she had seen that. She ran straight on in
the white darkness, and fell breathlessly against
the rough wall of the tower five minutes later.</p>

<p>The roke was thicker than ever after that momentary
lifting, but Joey didn't care now. There
was shelter and safety in the tower, and she felt
as though having reached it was the next best
thing to being safe at Redlands. Noreen had
told her it really was a good four miles from the
College, but it seemed comfortingly close when
one remembered that night on the leads.</p>

<p>Joey felt her way round it until she came to a
narrow door standing at least three feet above
the ground. She felt the ledge on which the door
opened with her fingers, scrambled up to it, and
tried the door. It was fastened, but she carried
a strong pocket-knife, and inserting the stoutest
blade into the chink, she forced back the bolt
which secured it on the inside, and opened the
door. Then, with a delightful thrill of mystery,
she scrambled through into the tower.</p>

<p>It was black-dark inside, not white-dark as it
was out; for the one narrow window on this
ground floor was shuttered. Joey longed for an
electric torch. She stumbled on a cautious step<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span>
or two; then, growing bolder, walked on three or
four more, with hands outstretched. Her hands
came into contact with a narrow shelf, and on it,
joy! she felt a match-box. Joey struck a match,
feeling as though all her troubles were over.</p>

<p>The flash gave her a rough notion of grey walls
and an iron ladder running up almost perpendicularly
to the right of her, and it showed something
else as well&mdash;a lantern that stood upon the
same shelf where she had found the matches.
Joey seized upon it, as a shipwrecked mariner
might on a spar, and lit it. Holding it in her
hand, she felt strong enough to face anything;
it was the darkness which had been so frightening.</p>

<p>Holding the lantern on high she set out to
explore her refuge; after all, for whatever reason,
it was rather exciting to find oneself in the mysterious
Round Tower at last.</p>

<p>The floor above was so high that the rays of
her lantern could not reach it, but she was sure
there was another floor because of the ladder,
which obviously must lead somewhere. Joey
thought she would go up it presently and see for
herself, but at present the ground floor of the
tower presented attractions. It was strewn with
a quantity of loose stones and <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</span> of all kinds,
except in one place&mdash;one can hardly say corner
in a round tower&mdash;where it would seem to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span>
been swept smooth. Joey, having wandered
round the loose-jointed grey walls, examining
them with interest, came to the place where the
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">d&eacute;bris</span> was comparatively scanty, and held her
lantern down to light the place.</p>

<p>A voice came up to her from below the floor,
a rather thin, peevish voice that sounded exceedingly
tired, and had a curious accent.</p>

<p>"You are at least two hours earlier than you
said you would be; how can you then expect me
to be ready?"</p>

<p>Joey quite jumped&mdash;the voice was so entirely
unexpected. Then she realised that she must be
taken for somebody else.</p>

<p>"I can't be anyone you expected two hours
later, because I didn't know myself about walking
home and this old fog," she said. "Do tell
me, are you down a trap-door, or what?"</p>

<p>A square of floor lifted with some difficulty,
and a head appeared&mdash;the head of a pale, unhealthy-looking
young man, with large, startled,
blue eyes.</p>

<p>"I say, I hope I didn't frighten you coming in
like this," Joey said politely. "But the fog&mdash;the
sea-roke, I think they call it, is so beastly, and I
couldn't find my way back."</p>

<p>The young man came altogether out from the
trap-door. Joey didn't think much of his nerves;
his hands were trembling and he looked as though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
Gavin could have knocked him down quite easily.</p>

<p>"Do you live here?" Joey asked, as he did not
speak. "I hope you don't mind my coming in
like this; but Noreen, one of the Redlands girls,
tells me that the Deeps are really rather dangerous
when the roke is about."</p>

<p>The young man seemed to recover his breath.</p>

<p>"You are a Redlands young lady, are you?
Surely your mistress does not know that you are
wandering about the Deeps alone?"</p>

<p>"Miss Conyngham? No, I don't suppose she
does," Joey said easily. "I didn't know myself
till it happened, but of course I ought to have
come by the road."</p>

<div class="figcenter">

<p class="caption">"I HOPE I DIDN'T FRIGHTEN YOU COMING IN LIKE THIS," JOEY SAID POLITELY</p>
</div>

<p>"It would be <em>much</em> safer," the young man said
impressively. He did not answer Joey's question
about living in the tower; but proceeded to tell
her story upon story of accidents happening on
the Deeps to people who strayed there in the fog
or the dark. Joey thought his stories were a little
like the <em>Cautionary Tales</em>; from his account the
sea-roke perpetually lay in wait, in company with
horrid oozy spots where people disappeared with
no trace left to tell how they had died. His
stories were so interesting that Joey forgot her
desire to explore, and sat by his side on a great
block of fallen stone, listening with all her ears,
and foreseeing a thrilling time in Blue Dorm this
evening. She was so absorbed that she never<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>
noticed the lightening of the roke, until a long,
narrow bar of sunshine fell through a chink in the
shutters of the window, making the red glow of
the lantern look pale and unnatural. Then she
jumped up in a hurry, and held out her hand.
The post went out at six on Sundays, and she
still had four miles to walk before she could write
that apology to Cousin Greta. She must go at
once now it would be safe to cross the piece of
marsh-land to the road. She held out her hand
to the young man.</p>

<p>"Good-bye," she said. "You've been a brick
to me, and I've enjoyed your stories most awfully.
I've had no end of a good time here, and
it's jolly thrilling, when you haven't done it, to
know you might have been drowned so easily,
isn't it? It's been a topping afternoon. Thanks
ever so."</p>

<p>She shook hands with the young man, whose
easily scared breath seemed to have departed
again, for he gasped and said nothing.</p>

<p>Joey turned her back upon the Round Tower
and turned her face in the direction of the road,
now plainly to be seen. It was not till she had
reached it that it struck her that she had been
rather stupid not to ask leave to come again, and
bring her friends. But perhaps now the young
man was used to her, he wouldn't mind if three
or four of them turned up one afternoon, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[Pg 132]</a></span>
asked for some more of his stories, and permission
to explore? Joey settled in her own mind
that she would share the privilege with Noreen
and Gabrielle at least. But one couldn't go back
to ask leave, with the thought of the six o'clock
post and that letter of apology still to be written
for it.</p>

<p>Joey covered the ground at her best pace,
never looking back; reached the road quite successfully
and, by dint of running most of the way,
arrived, panting, at the side door of Redlands,
just as the gong sounded for five o'clock tea.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="12">XII</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">In Trouble</small></h2>

<p>Joey slipped into her place at table, hoping
that Miss Lambton would not notice her
grubby hands and rough hair. There had only
been just time to tear off her coat and hat in the
nearest cloakroom, belonging to the Sixth Form
by right; tidying had to go by the board.</p>

<p>She squeezed in between Noreen and Barbara.
"I've got a scrummy box of chocs," she whispered.</p>

<p>Noreen gave quite a start. "Hullo! You've
turned up. Half the Lower School have been
leading weary lives about you this afternoon!"</p>

<p>"Why?" demanded Joey.</p>

<p>"Oh, your cousin 'phoned, apparently, and
said you'd gone off by yourself, and the chauffeur
couldn't see you along the road, and then the
roke came up and they were afraid something
might happen to you...."</p>

<p>"Likely&mdash;I'm not a kid," Joey stated, with
immense scorn. "But I'm awfully sorry anyone
bothered. Am I in a row?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span></p>

<p>"'Fraid so. What possessed you to bolt off
like that, you goat?"</p>

<p>"Oh, I don't know. I wanted to come back."</p>

<p>"You're cracked, I think," Barbara said uncompromisingly.
"Don't you know girls are always
sent back when they're at school?"</p>

<p>"I couldn't know there was going to be such
a rotten old fuss about it," Joey complained.
"However, if I'm in for it, I am. I've got the
chocs, anyhow; we'll orgy in Blue Dorm to-night."</p>

<p>"Jocelyn Graham!" Miss Lambton spoke
sharply from her end of her table. "Hurry with
your tea, please, and then go to Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Lambton," Joey answered ruefully,
and then added to Noreen, "Hope she'll
leave me time to write and apologise to Cousin
Greta."</p>

<p>"You'll be lucky if she's finished rowing you
by supper-time," Noreen remarked unkindly, but
added, after a second, "Don't worry; I don't
suppose you'll catch it much, as you're new. Say
you didn't know."</p>

<p>"Say there's insanity in the family and you
<em>hope</em> it isn't coming out," suggested Barbara;
but Joey was too much depressed to be drawn
by this remark. She finished her tea in haste,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[Pg 135]</a></span>
and was dispatched by Miss Lambton to Miss
Conyngham, without waiting for grace.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham's "Come in" was rather
severe. Joey screwed up her courage and opened
the door.</p>

<p>"Please, Miss Lambton said I was to come,"
she said meekly.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham was standing by the fire; she
looked tall and imposing&mdash;much taller and more
terrifying than in that first interview, poor Joey
thought.</p>

<p>"What have you been doing, Jocelyn?" she
asked, and her voice, though quiet, was very cold.</p>

<p>Joey pulled herself together.</p>

<p>"I'm very sorry if it wasn't the right thing,"
she said; "but I came away earlier from my
cousin's, because&mdash;because&mdash;I wanted to&mdash;and
I've made up my letter of apology, truly; quite
a polite one, and if you could finish rowing me
in time for the post, I should be frightfully
obliged, because Mums hates impoliteness."</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham said nothing for a minute,
but looked attentively at Joey.</p>

<p>"You are thirteen, I think," she said, at last,
"old enough to understand that you have done
rather an inexcusable thing this afternoon. If it
had been little Bertillia, I should not have been
surprised&mdash;one expects a baby to occasionally act
on an absurd impulse, and that is why babies are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span>
in charge of someone, always. You are a girl of
thirteen, with plenty of brains if you choose to
make use of them, and yet, because presumably
you were not enjoying yourself, you were guilty
of very gross discourtesy towards your cousin,
and of a breach of trust towards me. I grant
that perhaps you did not understand it is a college
rule that no girl goes out alone; but you
heard me arrange with your cousin to bring you
back in time for chapel at 6.30, so you knew what
my wishes were."</p>

<p>"Yes," murmured Joey, staring hard at a picture
opposite&mdash;a little patch of purple heather,
and a group of yellowing birches that reminded
her of Calgarloch and home. Noreen and Barbara
had prepared her for a row, but she had <em>not</em>
been prepared for the horrid effect of the Head's
quiet, cold voice.</p>

<p>"Your cousin telephoned here in great anxiety
when she found that you had gone," Miss Conyngham
went on, "and when there was no sign
of you on the road we all knew you must be coming
by the Deeps, in the sea-roke. You did a
very dangerous as well as a very wrong thing,
Jocelyn; do you know that?"</p>

<p>"The man in the tower told me so, most kindly,"
Joey explained; "but I didn't do it on purpose.
Honour! And I had a reason, a real
proper reason for leaving Cousin Greta's on my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
own&mdash;only it wasn't one I could say to her. It
<em>wasn't</em> just not enjoying myself: I was enjoying
myself quite with John&mdash;that is Gracie's snotty
cousin, worth ten of her any day...."</p>

<p>"That will do," interrupted Miss Conyngham.
"I am glad you had any reason in what you did;
but nothing can make it excusable. I have always
been proud to trust our Redlands girls in
every way; do you realise that when you act as
you have done you are bringing discredit on us
all? And a girl owes loyalty to her school above
everything!"</p>

<p>Joey swallowed hard. "Well, I'm frightfully
sorry, Miss Conyngham. I ... I should think
you had better punish me&mdash;only, might I go now,
because of writing to Cousin Greta?"</p>

<p>"You had better telephone to your cousin,"
Miss Conyngham said gravely. "I will put you
through in a minute. Yes, I think you must be
punished, not because I am angry but to help
you to remember. You are not to talk to the
others in Blue Dormitory for a week, and go to
bed directly after supper during that time. Do
you think you can remember?"</p>

<p>Joey gasped. "You couldn't make it French
verbs instead? I'm awful at French verbs&mdash;ask
Maddy."</p>

<p>"People don't choose their own punishments,
Jocelyn," the Head told her, with the ghost of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>
smile. "It must be as I said: can you remember,
do you think? You see, I am trusting to your
honour."</p>

<p>"Yes, I'll remember," Joey said mournfully,
"but it will be beastly. I hope it will square up
all the bother I've given you a bit, though."</p>

<p>"We will see what it can do," said Miss Conyngham
in a kinder voice. "Now I will put you
through to your cousin."</p>

<p>The telephone was still rather a mystery to
Joey; but she squeezed the middle of the receiver
as Miss Conyngham directed, and said "Hullo."
Then Miss Conyngham went out and left her.</p>

<p>"Is that you, Cousin Greta?" Joey inquired in
a high-pitched unnatural voice. "Then, please,
I'm most awfully sorry, and I didn't mean to be
rude, or make you anxious&mdash;just I thought I'd
better come home early...."</p>

<p>Cousin Greta interrupted. "I know, dear;
John told me. Don't think any more about it;
I am only too thankful you are safe. You must
come over on another Sunday very soon, and we
will try and give you a really happy time."</p>

<p>Joey felt more choky than she had done
through all Miss Conyngham's harangue.</p>

<p>"It's no end brickish of you," she stammered,
forgetting to speak in what she thought was a
telephone voice, and becoming much more audible
in consequence. "You were fearfully kind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>
to-day, and it's frightfully nice of you not to be
mad!"</p>

<p>She rang off, and went to find her chocolates,
feeling distinctly happier. She met Noreen in
the passage, and thrust the box into her hands.</p>

<p>"Look here, you'd better keep them and orgie,"
she said. "I'm not to talk for a week in dorm."</p>

<p>"What a sickening shame! But we'll keep the
chocs till the week's up," Noreen said cheerfully.
"My hat-box will do; Matron never pokes her
nose into that. Keep smiling, old thing; it's rotten,
I know, but we'll simply have the bust of our
lives when the week's up, and you're clear."</p>

<p>Joey went up to bed directly after supper that
night as commanded, but feeling less depressed
than might have been expected. For one thing,
Miss Conyngham had addressed her in quite an
ordinary tone at supper; for another, Cousin
Greta had been so unexpectedly nice. And
Noreen's friendship came in a good third. Joey
looked forward determinedly to next Sunday,
when chocolates should be eaten in wild profusion
in the watches of the night, to the accompaniment
of the nervous young man's gruesome stories of
what happened to people wandering casually
about the Deeps.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="13">XIII</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">"The Three Musketeers"</small></h2>

<p>Miss Craigie was to come back on the
day after Joey was restored to the ordinary
privileges of Blue Dorm. Miss Conyngham
sent for Joey after breakfast and mentioned the
fact, asking very kindly if she would like to go
and meet the four train, instead of joining her
form "croc."</p>

<p>"Choose a companion," she said; "and, of
course, I trust you to go and come back by the
road, Jocelyn."</p>

<p>Joey coloured up. "It's ever so good of you,
Miss Conyngham; of course I'll play fair. But
please, is there ever a time when you could let
us go on the Deeps?&mdash;for that tower is most
frightfully interesting."</p>

<p>"The owner lives in London, I believe, and
doesn't allow people to go over it," Miss Conyngham
said. "It isn't supposed to be very safe
now, for scrambling about in. But I will try to
find out if he would have any objections to my
taking a party of you girls, if you are so very
keen."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span></p>

<p>"I think it would do that nervous chap good to
see some company," urged Joey. "You can't
think what his jumpiness was like, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham was as usual extremely busy,
and could not wait to enter into the question.</p>

<p>"Which companion, Jocelyn?"</p>

<p>"<em>Could</em> I have two?" asked Joey, greatly daring.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham considered. "I don't see any
objection, if you will all behave very steadily.
Remember the credit of Redlands is in your
hands. Whom do you want?"</p>

<p>"Please, Gabrielle and Noreen."</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham smiled. "Very well. Are
you three friends?"</p>

<p>Joey had become a good deal more certain
since Cousin Greta asked that question.</p>

<p>"Rather, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>"I am glad to hear that. Gabrielle is a very
good sort of friend to have, Jocelyn."</p>

<p>"And Noreen is a frightfully exciting one,"
Joey explained&mdash;and then remembered in time it
would be better not to explain why.</p>

<p>She discovered that she had gone up in the
opinion of the Lower School now that Miss
Conyngham had actually picked her out to meet
Miss Craigie. The mathematical mistress had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[Pg 142]</a></span>
many adorers, it appeared&mdash;and meeting trains
could only be done by very special permission.</p>

<p>Ingrid Latimer herself accosted Joey in the
mid-morning interval, demanding what she
meant by going.</p>

<p>"I suppose Miss Conyngham thought I should
like it," Joey said, slightly flustered by the question
from one so great as the Senior Prefect.</p>

<p>"Rubbish! As though the Head would stop
to think about that," Ingrid answered crushingly.
"Think again, Kid. Is she an aunt of yours by
any chance?"</p>

<p>"No&mdash;but we both live in Scotland, you see,"
Joey suggested.</p>

<p>"The cheek of the babe&mdash;as though Scotland
were a private belonging of those two," burst in
another huge Sixth Former, and Ingrid suddenly
put both arms round Joey and lifted her on to a
desk. "Now there you stay, until you have supplied
a really adequate reason why you&mdash;merely
an uppish new kid&mdash;should be granted the glorious
privilege of meeting our Miss Craigie."</p>

<p>Joey considered. "Want the real reason?"</p>

<p>"Yes, and hurry up with it."</p>

<p>Joey grinned. "Then go on wanting it!"</p>

<p>The bell for Third Lesson rang violently.</p>

<p>"Oh, get off that desk and go to your classroom,"
ordered Ingrid. "You are the purple<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>
limit in assertiveness. <em>I</em> don't know why I put
up with it."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps because you can't help it," suggested
Joey, and then she scuttled past Ingrid at her
best speed, and joined a gasping Noreen at the
door.</p>

<p>"Are you whole and entire?" Noreen demanded.
"My dear Joey, Ingrid will strew the
floor with your remains if you don't look out.
<em>I'd</em> never dare speak to her like that; I'd sooner
cheek Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>"<em>I</em> don't mind Ingrid," Joey boasted, vain-gloriously.
"It's rather sport to see what she'll
say next."</p>

<p>"No talking!" rapped out the Latin master,
and Noreen began to gabble over her work to
herself with great energy.</p>

<p>Joey felt fairly sure of hers, so devoted the
spare two or three minutes, while Mr. Reade
surveyed his notes, to drawing an extremely
fancy portrait of herself and Ingrid walking
down the Queen's Hall arm in arm, while portions
of the Lower School cowered in doorways,
or hurried obsequiously to right and left. This
work of art was duly shown to Noreen, as soon as
a flustered Barbara was put on to construe;
Noreen retorted with a furious "Just you wait!"</p>

<p>Joey's assertiveness was kindly ignored in the
afternoon, however, in view of the fact that she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>
had won the privilege of meeting the train for
her friends, and the three set out very cheerfully
and a good ten minutes earlier than they need
have done.</p>

<p>"How's the Professor?" Joey asked, as they
passed the Lab, where she had spent those purgatorial
minutes on her first arrival. It had been
arranged by Miss Conyngham that she should not
take chemistry till next term, in view of the host
of bewildering new subjects that descend upon a
girl fresh to school.</p>

<p>Noreen screwed up her eyes. "Well, his temper
isn't on the mend. If he goes on being such
a beast I shall cook up a pathetic letter to the
pater and tell him I'm overworked."</p>

<p>"I should think <em>he</em> is," suggested Gabrielle
quietly. "Have you noticed how pouchy he is
under the eyes?&mdash;as though he didn't get enough
sleep."</p>

<p>"Well, whatever is the matter with him, he's a
holy terror to work with," Noreen declared unsympathetically.
"I say, Gabrielle, I wish Joey
did take stinks&mdash;her uppishness would probably
drive him clean over the border, and we shouldn't
have to bear with him any more."</p>

<p>"You've jolly well got to be uppish here if you
don't want to be absolutely squashed," Joey explained.
"I expect the Professor has war-strain;
there was an English lady came to stay with us<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[Pg 145]</a></span>
who simply couldn't stand Bingo blowing a trumpet
anywhere near her because she had that, poor
thing."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps he has a bad conscience, and is doing
something beastly with his stinks," suggested
Noreen. "I say, wouldn't it be a good thing to
find out which it is? If it's war-strain&mdash;well, I'll
bear his utter hatefulness and calling me 'fat-head'
before the class, with cheerfulness; though
I'm sure he's too old and too stout to have fought
the Huns&mdash;still, he <em>may</em> have done munitions
and used his chemistry that way...."</p>

<p>"Wasn't he here in the war?" asked Joey.</p>

<p>"Rather not. He only came last term, and
nobody could stand him then. He's worse now.
So if it's an evil conscience&mdash;I say, Joey, you old
slacker, why don't you take stinks? You could
help no end in the Sherlock Holmes business.
Tell you what. I'll smuggle you in next time&mdash;Cicely
Wren is in San with a throat&mdash;he won't
notice who's there as long as he has his proper
tale of jumpy victims."</p>

<p>"Let's," Joey said; but much to her surprise
and disappointment, Gabrielle interfered quite
decidedly.</p>

<p>"No, that wouldn't do. You mustn't, Joey.
Don't try and get her to, Noreen."</p>

<p>"Don't see why not," grumbled Noreen, but
Joey noticed that she yielded to the rather small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[Pg 146]</a></span>
Head of the Lower School with only that one
murmur.</p>

<p>It was a dull, lowering afternoon, and the
Round Tower, standing up before the three,
looked gloomy and forbidding.</p>

<p>"Wonder if the jumpy young man is there
now?" Joey remarked. The whole story of her
adventure had been joyfully told last night in
Blue Dorm, to the accompaniment of a most unwise
amount of chocolates, and all Blue Dorm
was as keen to explore the shaky tower as she was
herself. And she and Gabrielle had shared a
milk tumbler at Break, after which Gabrielle had
been quite as much stirred up as the other three
were.</p>

<p>"It strikes me," said Noreen, "that we are living
in a mystery&mdash;probably lurid&mdash;and certainly
topping. Why should Joey's man be so jumpy?"
She paused dramatically.</p>

<p>"P'r'aps an air-raid bomb fell near him," suggested
Joey.</p>

<p>"Egg! A bomb took most of my Granny's
bed-room wall out one night, and she didn't turn
a hair. English people don't."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps he's Belgian. He didn't seem quite
English somehow."</p>

<p>"Well, if you meet him casually drop into
French, and see how he takes it."</p>

<p>"Drop into French yourself," urged Joey;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
"you always find that so jolly easy in French
conversation class."</p>

<p>"There! Listen to her, Gabrielle! Ever know
anything so cheeky?&mdash;and I'm nearly a year
older," complained Noreen.</p>

<p>Gabrielle was a peacemaker. "Oh, don't rag,
you two. I want to think about the Professor.
I wonder whether Miss Conyngham knows quite
how&mdash;how cranky he is? He quite frightened a
lot of the babies who were playing about near the
door of the Lab, the other day, Rosie told me.
He simply yelled at them, and no one ought to
do that with babies. It wasn't as though they
were trying to go in, or anything of that sort."</p>

<p>"I believe it's an evil conscience he's got,"
urged Noreen, with relish. "Why should he go
for the babies otherwise? There's no sense in it."</p>

<p>"Unless it's like our war-strainy visitor and
Bingo's trumpet," Joey said. "But she didn't go
for him&mdash;she only asked frightfully nicely if he
would mind blowing it farther off. The Professor
<em>is</em> a pig to the kids; I've noticed it. Do
you know Tiddles will never play that side of the
house at all?"</p>

<p>"He hasn't gone and frightened poor little
Tiddles, has he?" demanded Gabrielle indignantly.</p>

<p>"I don't know. I never asked. But she can't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[Pg 148]</a></span>
bear him," Joey said. "She won't come round
that way, even with me."</p>

<p>Gabrielle ruffled up like an angry robin.
"Well, that settles it. Of course, one can't go
sneaking of him to Miss Conyngham when it may
be war-strain, but I shall ask the Professor myself
if he will mind being careful where the babies
are concerned, poor little things."</p>

<p>Noreen and Joey gasped. "You won't? Why,
he'll be furious."</p>

<p>"It's my job to look after things like that,"
Gabrielle said firmly. "It's the choice between
pointing out quietly to him that babies mustn't
be frightened, and telling Miss Conyngham what
he's been doing&mdash;and I'm Head of the Lower.
And nobody tells about unfairness and things like
that at Coll; you just bear them, or alter them
for yourself."</p>

<p>"Well, you're a sport, Gabrielle," Noreen remarked
admiringly. "<em>I</em> wouldn't have the
pluck."</p>

<p>"Of course I shall put it quite politely," Gabrielle
told them. "Just say I am sure he would
be most disturbed if he knew that he frightened
the babies, and so on. I don't suppose he does it
on purpose."</p>

<p>"I do," Noreen said stubbornly. "Don't you,
Joey?"</p>

<p>"Haven't seen enough of him&mdash;but I do think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[Pg 149]</a></span>
he's a terror," Joey agreed; and then the station
came in sight and they left off talking about the
Professor and his ways, and talked of Miss
Craigie instead.</p>

<p>"You'll have to buck up over your maths now,
Joey," Gabrielle remarked. "She'll be so frightfully
keen to see you go top, if she's a friend of
yours."</p>

<p>"Joey is rather brainy over them," Noreen remarked
kindly. "I sometimes fear she's going to
turn into a swot after all."</p>

<p>"I'm not. I've been in quite as many rows for
talking in maths class as you, anyhow," Joey
retorted.</p>

<p>"Well, nobody talks when Miss Craigie takes
maths," Gabrielle said, and Noreen agreed a
trifle ruefully. "No, that's a true bill. You're
a frightfully strenuous crowd in Scotland, Joey.
Glad I wasn't born there."</p>

<p>"It's really rather funny we three should be
friends," Joey remarked. "Gabrielle English,
Noreen Irish, and I Scotch."</p>

<p>"We ought to make a pretty good alliance,
don't you think?" said Gabrielle in her quiet way.</p>

<p>"The three Musketeers," suggested Noreen.
"Let's stick together like they did&mdash;and I only
wish we could go in for as many rows!"</p>

<p>At which pious aspiration both Joey and Gabrielle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[Pg 150]</a></span>
laughed, for Noreen was notorious at Redlands
for the number and extent of her rows.</p>

<p>The train was rather late, but it came at last,
and among the few people getting out at Mote
Deeping, was a neat figure in a very well-cut coat
and skirt, who was only about half Mr. Craigie's
ungainly size, and not at all like him at first sight;
though Joey came a little later on to recognise
the familiar twinkle of the deep-set eyes and the
kindly smile. Just then she only knew Miss
Craigie by the ecstatic exclamation of Noreen
and Gabrielle, "That's her!"</p>

<p>Miss Craigie shook hands with them, and she
seemed to know who Joey was without a need of
Gabrielle's polite introduction. At the earnest
request of all the three, she consented to put all
her luggage into one of the wheezy cabs and walk
with them to Redlands.</p>

<p>She laid a hand on Joey's shoulder as they left
the little station. "Well, how goes it?"</p>

<p>Joey liked her voice, with its touch of soft
Scotch accent, and her eyes were very kind. She
took a deep breath.</p>

<p>"I've messed up my quilt taking it on the roof,
and Matron says it's a disgrace and ought to
make me ashamed every time I go to bed. And
I've starred a window, so it had to be mended;
and I've got into a row with the Head for arriving<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span>
home alone, and with Professor Trouville for
tidying his old Lab&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"That was my fault!" interrupted Noreen.</p>

<p>"And been turned out of French class once&mdash;but
Maddy was fearfully decent after&mdash;and out
of maths class twice for ragging...."</p>

<p>"I begin to feel quite anxious," Miss Craigie
said tranquilly; but even Joey understood the
truth of Noreen's statement, that there was no
ragging when Miss Craigie taught.</p>

<p>With Noreen squeezing her arm affectionately
on one side and Joey holding rather shyly to the
other, Miss Craigie walked the two miles to Redlands,
hearing much school news and asking
many questions, in especial about the prospects of
the big hockey match, Redlands <abbr title="versus"><i>v.</i></abbr> Lincolnshire
Ladies, which was always played towards the end
of October.</p>

<p>"It's to be at Deeping Royal this year," Gabrielle
said. "It was the Lincs Ladies' turn to
choose, you see."</p>

<p>"Selfish pigs, they might have chosen somewhere
nearer. Nine miles off; why, hardly any
of us will be able to go and look on," grumbled
Noreen.</p>

<p>"I think you will find that a certain number
will go by train," Miss Craigie said in her quiet
way. "You ought to be a poet, Noreen&mdash;you
do love to magnify a grievance."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p>Noreen joined in the laugh against herself; she
was always ready to do that.</p>

<p>"Well, I don't magnify the Stinks Professor,
anyway, Miss Craigie; he has grown into such an
ill-tempered beast, hasn't he, Gabby?"</p>

<p>Miss Craigie shook her head. "Unparliamentary
language, Noreen; stop it, please."</p>

<p>Noreen stopped quite meekly&mdash;rather to
Joey's disappointment. She would have liked to
consult Miss Craigie about the Professor and his
ways; however, if he wasn't to be talked about
there was an end of it. She asked instead where
Deeping Royal was.</p>

<p>"Away beyond the big reservoir&mdash;much nearer
the Fossdyke Wash than we are," Noreen explained.
"Gorgeous fields, if it's fine&mdash;but&mdash;when
it's wet&mdash;Help! I wish they would play us
at Redlands&mdash;we're always all right."</p>

<p>"And who will be allowed to go besides the
Team?" Joey next asked anxiously.</p>

<p>"Oh, when we play outside and have to drive
or go by train, each member of the Team can
take a friend, and the Heads of the Upper and
Lower School can take two. You'll take us,
won't you, Gabrielle?" Noreen demanded breathlessly.</p>

<p>Joey gasped at the audacity of this suggestion,
but Gabrielle answered composedly.</p>

<p>"You were the two I meant to ask, <em>of course</em>."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[Pg 153]</a></span>
Joey walked the rest of the way back treading on
air, and refrained from swanking aggressively to
either Gabrielle or Noreen when Miss Craigie
invited her to come and help unpack after tea.</p>

<p>Afterwards, when several very big things had
happened, she looked back on that blissful afternoon,
and saw the result of that threefold friendship.</p>

<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="14">XIV</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">"The Play's the Thing"</small></h2>

<p>"<em>I</em> think we ought to do something to celebrate
Miss Craigie's return," remarked
Noreen.</p>

<p>They were dressing for supper in Blue Dorm,
Joey, Barbara, Syb, and Noreen; and as usual
they were dressing in a hurry.</p>

<p>"What sort of thing?" Joey demanded, trying
to disentangle hooks from her hair.</p>

<p>"Something to show we're jolly pleased she's
come back. Just think, she might have died of
that loathly 'flu'; lots of people have."</p>

<p>"Shut it, you old ghoul," ordered Barbara;
"she's all right again now, thank goodness!"</p>

<p>"And we ought to celebrate her all-rightness,"
Noreen said triumphantly.</p>

<p>"Violets?" suggested Joey.</p>

<p>"Silly cuckoo, how are we to get them?"</p>

<p>"What <em>do</em> you want, Noreen?" Syb asked impatiently.</p>

<p>"How about charades after supper&mdash;and ask
her to come and see them?"</p>

<p>"Frightfully short time to think of anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span>
decent," objected Syb; "besides, Miss Craigie
won't want to leave her dear Miss Lambton, you
bet."</p>

<p>"Let's ask her too."</p>

<p>"That doesn't give us a decent charade."</p>

<p>"Can't we think of something?"</p>

<p>"Not something good enough."</p>

<p>"P'r'aps you'd like to do some scenes from
<em>Hamlet</em>, if you want to be so very high-class,"
Noreen suggested scornfully. Remove II. B
were taking <em>Hamlet</em> in literature, and Noreen
and the Literature Mistress were usually at loggerheads.</p>

<p>It was that suggestion which gave Joey her
idea. "I say," she burst out, "why shouldn't we
do a charade on the lines of Hamlet's player-people?
You know&mdash;where the poison was
poured into the poor chap's ear&mdash;and ask all the
Staff to come, and see whether the Professor
looks guilty and shrieks, 'Lights!' because he's
doing something evil with his stinks, as Noreen
says, or just has a war-strain appearance. It
needn't be a noisy charade to upset him if it's just
strain."</p>

<p>Noreen thumped Joey on the back. "Topping
plan! What word shall we have?"</p>

<p>"German?" suggested Joey. "The first syllable
could be Germ, you know&mdash;those things
Matron is always fussing about&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[Pg 156]</a></span></p>

<p>"Or the Huns putting them into wells," Barbara
interrupted in great excitement.</p>

<p>"What about 'an'?" asked Syb.</p>

<p>"Couldn't she be a German girl, called Anne,
Anna really, who is pretending to be a schoolgirl,
and really plotting and spying?" Joey said.</p>

<p>"My word, Joey, you're coming on. I'm less
surprised you got the scholarship," Noreen cried.
"We&mdash;Gabrielle and Joey and I&mdash;settled this
afternoon that someone ought to look into the
matter of the Professor's hatefulness, and it's us
that are going to," she added cheerfully and ungrammatically,
for the benefit of Syb and Barbara.
"If he's all right our charade won't hurt
him&mdash;he'll like it; if he's not...."</p>

<p>The gong sounded.</p>

<p>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Soufflez</span>! <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Regardez glissant, mes enfants</span>,"
Noreen cried, tying her hair-ribbon with desperate
speed. "We must fix up our charade after
supper; and look here! we must get some of the
others to perform first, while we're fixing it. Ingrid
might recite,&mdash;she's awfully good,&mdash;and
we'll get Gabrielle to fiddle. Joey, you'd better
do the asking Miss Craigie&mdash;oh, and of course
you'll have to go to the Head first, as we want
all the Staff. Point out it's an occasion."</p>

<p>"Oh, I say, won't one of you?" asked poor
Joey; but Noreen was adamant.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span></p>

<p>"You're rather in favour with the Head, I believe,
and anyhow you've swanked enough about
Miss Craigie. It's clearly your duty to get leave
for the show. We'll do the rest."</p>

<p>"All right," Joey agreed resignedly, and then
the inhabitants of Blue Dorm tore downstairs at
a record pace, only just escaping an order mark
for lateness by the skin of their teeth.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham received Joey's request very
graciously, and promised to invite the Staff to
witness the performance and bring them with her
to Queen's Hall in half an hour's time. Joey
flew back, very satisfied to find Noreen, Barbara,
and Sybil in one of the small classrooms, opening
from the Hall, distractedly considering the all-important
charade. But they were cheerful too,
for it appeared that Ingrid had consented to
recite, and Gabrielle and the musical genius of
Remove II., Clare Estcome, to play.</p>

<p>"We'll put the play last," Noreen said impressively,
"and we four will do it, and say nothing
to anybody else. Joey, just tell some of these
juniors who are doing nothing to arrange the
chairs for a show and pull the curtains across the
platform; and then we can get on to our job.
You're sure the Professor is coming?"</p>

<p>"Miss Conyngham laughed frightfully nicely
and said she was sure all the Staff would be delighted,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
and she thought it a topping idea," Joey
said; and on that the four got to work in earnest.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Miss Conyngham gave gracious permission for
the two forms below Remove II. to sit up for the
performance, so a large audience was already
assembled when the staff of Redlands swept into
the Queen's Hall&mdash;Miss Conyngham with her
arm through Miss Craigie's&mdash;to place themselves
in the "stalls" specially retained for them. Joey,
watching through a chink in the curtains shutting
off the platform, was delighted to see that
the Professor sat upon the other side of Miss
Conyngham. He looked placid and pleased
enough now, so far as his large, pallid face could
be said to show any expression at all. The audience
was further swelled by the servants, indoor
and out, even including two or three men who
were repairing pipes.</p>

<p>The performance began with Gabrielle's
newest violin-piece&mdash;a nocturne, executed very
correctly but rather nervously. The school
applauded vigorously, as they would have applauded
anything from the popular Heads of
the Upper or Lower School. Ingrid followed,
jarringly dramatic in Noyes' <em>Highwayman</em>, and
was violently appreciated. Clare, not having to
face her audience, the piano being sideways to
the stage, gave the most successful performance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[Pg 159]</a></span>
of the three, but took a strictly secondary place
in the way of applause.</p>

<p>Then, after some whispering and stifled giggling,
Joey was pushed forward to the front of
the stage, and the curtain drawn back a chink.
She spoke through it.</p>

<p>"I have to announce that the forthcoming
charade is in two syllables and three scenes. The
third is the complete word."</p>

<p>She withdrew, and all the juniors started
thinking aloud of two-syllabled words. They
were quite audible on the stage, where Barbara,
spectacled and padded as to body, was bending
over a steaming fish-kettle, prodding it nervously.
"I thought if you <em>boiled</em> germs you
killed them," she whispered. "This seems so
jolly like the witches in <em>Macbeth</em>."</p>

<p>"Go on, you silly ass," urged Noreen. "It
looks all right anyhow, and you've got the photo-plates
for growing the germs on. Come on, Joey,
I must tie you up."</p>

<p>Joey, attired in a plaid going-out frock belonging
to one of the little ones, to represent a
kilt, a khaki sports coat, buttoned across, and
two box straps for a Sam-Browne belt, was forthwith
lashed brutally to a curtain pole, and ordered
not to so much as breathe for fear she
should move it and it should become plain to the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[Pg 160]</a></span>
audience that it was leaning against her and she
could have walked off with it quite easily.</p>

<p>Syb, also rather sketchy as to uniform, but with
an unmistakable German cap to make her nationality
clear, stood by with a home-made bayonet
of stupendous size. Noreen, pillowy as to
figure and checked as to blouse, and with her
curly, dark hair tightly strained off her forehead,
hovered near the Professor, with a large wooden
spoon, whether to stir soup or germs seemed
doubtful. She waved this spoon impressively,
and sent a thrilling whisper to the side of "Draw
the curtains."</p>

<p>The curtains jerked back and after a pause to
allow of sufficient thrill upon the part of the audience,
Noreen inquired sepulchrally:</p>

<p>"<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Mein fater</span>, <em>is</em> the mixture slab and strong?"</p>

<p>"As strong as thy soup on Sundays, my daughter,"
was the reply. "As strong as the accursed
British Army thinks it is&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"And proves it is," remarked the dauntless
captive at the curtain pole, and was promptly
prodded with the bayonet to induce a respectful
silence.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="Illustration_MEIN_FATER_IS_THE_MIXTURE_SLAB_AND_STRONG" id="Illustration_MEIN_FATER_IS_THE_MIXTURE_SLAB_AND_STRONG"><img src="images/mein.jpg" alt="Mein" width="431" height="665" /></a>
<p class="caption">"MEIN FATER, IS THE MIXTURE SLAB AND STRONG?"</p>
</div>

<p>The Professor, in very good English, with an
occasional lapse into a German word, and a masterly
repetition of "Tod und Teufel!" at regular
intervals, proceeded to explain to his intelligent
daughter (who stirred soup over a stove at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[Pg 161]</a></span>
back of the stage, between times to add realism)
that he was engaged in growing germs of a horrible
disease which was to go as far as possible
towards exterminating the "accursed Englanders,"
and that when he had, so to speak, bottled
them, she was to take them to England and cast
them into all receptacles of drinking water
throughout the kingdom. To avert suspicion she
was to let her hair down, attire herself in a djibbah,
and assume the character of an English
schoolgirl. The fair Anna delightedly accepted
the commission, and retired from the stage to
change the checked blouse, and the Professor
ladled out presumably spoonfuls of germ on to
the photographic slides, while informing the
English prisoner that his accursed race would
soon be non-existent. The Englishman, returning
an undaunted reply, was again prodded violently,
and Anna returning in a djibbah and
looking marvellously thinner, passed him with the
taunting gibe that she would pass anywhere as
an English girl, and he was powerless to save his
country, and marched out <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en route</i> for England,
carrying a dispatch case full of bottled germs.</p>

<p>The Professor and the guard thereupon sat
down to drink "Confusion to perfidious England,"
which they did with great gusto and succumbed
to the force of brandy neat (they stated
it was that) with much speed. As soon as they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[Pg 162]</a></span>
had their heads down on a table, which shook
with their snores, the English prisoner set to
work to free himself, and succeeded in doing so
just as the curtains were drawn in obedience to
frenzied whispers from Noreen from behind.
Joey laid down her curtain pole, and flew to the
chink, regardless of the flattering applause that
was greeting the first scene of this thrilling
drama.</p>

<p>"What is the Professor looking like, Noreen?"</p>

<p>"He's clapping quite a lot," Noreen explained,
in a gusty whisper; and Joey, peering over her
shoulder at the large, pallid face and the black
moustache, saw that Noreen was quite right. The
Professor was clapping as vigorously as Miss
Craigie herself.</p>

<p>"It must be war-strain," said Joey, and they
rang up the curtain on Scene II., which showed
Anna or Anne in her dormitory at a girls' school,
which appeared to consist in one other girl only
and a superannuated mistress (Syb), whose aggressive
spectacles did not seem much to assist
her defective sight. She tottered up to say good-night
to her pupils, calling Barbara out with her
to unhook her dress, which opportunity was
seized upon by Anna to mention in a brief soliloquy,
that she was only waiting till her room-mate
was asleep to steal out and introduce her father's
germs (alternately alluded to as "flu-bugs" and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span>
"bubonic plague") into the neighbouring reservoir,
this proceeding being the prelude to the
abrupt departure of "Anne" from the English
pig-dog boarding-school for good.</p>

<p>Barbara returned on the enunciation of this
sentiment, and after a brief conversation with the
obviously unsympathetic Anne about her brother&mdash;a
prisoner in Germany&mdash;the two girls lay down
in their dressing-gowns upon a sofa that was
rather a tight fit for one, and fell instantly into
sound stage slumber.</p>

<p>After a thrilling moment of silence, Anne rose
up, lit a candle, held it close to the eyes of the
slumbering Barbara, and remarking, "She sleeps,
the English pig-dog. Ach Himmel! Now can
I do what I will," she seized the Horlick's Malted
Milk bottle, large size, which contained the
germs, and stole out. She had hardly closed the
door when Barbara sat up, crying, "Am I dreaming,
or did she say pig-dog? If so, she is no
English Anne, but a German spy among us.
And what has she gone to do?"</p>

<p>The question was answered by a call from beneath
the window at the back of the stage, and
Barbara, dashing to it, called, "Jock! It's never
you! Come up; I'm alone."</p>

<p>Joey, hoisted from below by Ingrid, appeared
at the open window, with, triumph of realism,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span>
her hair and clothes wet, for it was raining; struggled
through, with much display of thin legs, and
said dramatically, "Has she loosed her bugs?"</p>

<p>The explanation that followed was a triumph
of brevity, and brother and sister dashed out to
try and cut Anne off before she reached the
reservoir. The curtain fell, amid tumultuous applause,
and a jovial request from Professor
Trouville that they would be "vary careful not
to drop the bottle and let zose fierce animals
loose upon us."</p>

<p>The third scene required no preparation, and
was brief indeed. The aged Head Mistress discovered
asking frantically, of no one in particular,
what can have happened to her pupils; to
her enter Joey and Barbara, dragging between
them Anne, defiant, and with the germ bottle
torn from her hand&mdash;unopened.</p>

<p>The Highland officer explained the situation
in two sentences, and Anne, in a superior German
accent, mentioned that from her point of
view to torture prisoners and let loose disease
upon women and children were right and proper&mdash;because
she was&mdash;<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hoch</span>! <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Hoch</span>! a German!</p>

<p>Curtain, amid thunders of applause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>The four came down into the hall to be congratulated.
Miss Conyngham paid a stately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[Pg 165]</a></span>
compliment to the acting; Miss Craigie, with a
grave face, rather belied by her twinkling eyes,
admired the chemistry; even Ingrid remarked
condescendingly, "Not half bad for kids."</p>

<p>Joey, standing in the midst of a congratulatory
group of Remove II. B girls, felt a touch
on her arm, and, turning, found herself face to
face with the Professor. He was smiling quite
pleasantly.</p>

<p>"A clefare and entertaining little play, Mees
Jocelyn Graham," he said. "And it is you that
plan it, is it not? My congratulations."</p>

<p>"Oh, thanks awfully; but it wasn't me really&mdash;we
all four did it," Joey began, in some confusion,
when Noreen caught what she said, and
interrupted.</p>

<p>"Don't listen to her, Professor Trouville; she
planned it really; and it was jolly brainy of her,
wasn't it?"</p>

<p>The Professor smiled, his curious, sphinx-like
smile.</p>

<p>"I thank you, Mees Noreen. I thought that
I congratulate the right one, but your friend of
the scholarship is modest, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n'est ce pas</i>?"</p>

<p>"Really the old chap was quite human for
once, wasn't he?" Noreen remarked, as the four
went up to Blue Dorm a few minutes later. "I
hope Gabrielle went for him about the babes
while he was in this yielding mood. She won't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">[Pg 166]</a></span>
get her nose snapped off quite so close to her
face."</p>

<p>But Joey didn't answer; she was wondering
why it was that she had found the Professor's
pleasantness so singularly unpleasant.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="15">XV</abbr><br />

<small class="small-caps">The Court-Martial</small></h2>

<p>Joey couldn't go to sleep that night. She
was excited, and all kinds of thoughts went
whirling round and round in her head, making
sleep impossible.</p>

<p>The whole day had been exciting&mdash;the play
had only been the culmination of it all. The
walk to the station&mdash;the conversation about Professor
Trouville and his queerness; on top of that
the thrill of being coupled with Noreen in Gabrielle's
invitation to the great match; the long talk
about home-things with Miss Craigie in her bedroom;
and then the play.</p>

<p>It was this last, probably, that turned her
thoughts so much to Father, dying far away from
them all, among his enemies.</p>

<p>The man who had been Father's special friend
among the prisoners had come to see Mums,
when the Armistice released those of our men
who had survived the German treatment, and had
told her that Father was taken from the prison
camp in a dying state, and word had come back
a few days later that he was dead.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[Pg 168]</a></span></p>

<p>Captain Verney had done his very best, delaying
his own return, to find out for Mums just
how he died and where he had been buried, but
it seemed that no one knew or cared; and Uncle
Staff had had no better luck when he went out
with a War-Office permit to investigate a few
weeks later. Mums and the children had just the
one consolation of knowing that Father died for
England just as surely as though he had been
shot going over the top, to help them bear the
thought of the long weeks of suffering and ill-usage
which had come first. If only escaping
from prison were as easy as it seemed in books
and plays, Joey thought, tossing restlessly, she
and Gavin would have been out in Germany with
a file and a bottle of chloroform, and have set
Father free before the Huns had time to kill
him. But in real life you could do nothing except
wait and wait and say your prayers, and
take care of Mums.</p>

<p>Joey sat up in bed, and stared out at the
dark window-pane so close to her. It was a
mild, damp night&mdash;she threw off her quilt&mdash;perhaps
she was too hot and that was the reason
that she could not sleep. And while she was sitting
up, she saw something flash in the darkness,
and knew in a second what it was. A series of
short blue flashes, coming from the dark.</p>

<p>"How funny!" was her first thought, and then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span>
she suddenly called to mind John's signalling instructions;
that was the "call-up" in Morse.
Somebody, it seemed, was going to practise his
signalling now, at nearly twelve at night. Joey
crept out of bed, and crouched on the window-sill
so as to miss nothing.</p>

<p>There was disappointingly little to see; the
people, whoever they were, were not nearly such
keen signallers as John was. Something came
from the side of the house&mdash;from her window
Joey couldn't locate it exactly&mdash;three long flashes
and two short ones. Then, a minute later, from
the distance&mdash;one of the letters she had used with
John&mdash;short, long, long, long, and then a short-long.</p>

<p>And that was all.</p>

<p>Joey sat crouched on the window-sill for quite
a long time, but nothing more happened. Then,
just as she was thinking of getting back to bed,
someone came round the corner of the house far
below. It was the Professor. She saw him unmistakably
in the light of an electric torch, which
he must have pressed for an instant, perhaps to
show him the path. He slept, as Joey knew,
in a room on the ground floor of the lodge; he had
chosen it because he so often worked late at the
Lab and did not want to disturb the lodge-keeper
and his wife.</p>

<p>She wondered whether it was he who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span>
signalling; somehow you would not expect an
ill-tempered chemistry professor to want to practise
signalling, especially about twelve o'clock at
night.</p>

<p>Of course, German spies used to signal in wartime,
but then the Professor wasn't German: his
name was French, and the look of him was more
French than German, and he spoke with a French
accent, and, most important proof of all, he had
laughed and been quite genial about the play, instead
of giving himself away as Hamlet's uncle
had done. Besides, English people had settled
they wouldn't have Huns creeping in among
them again, and though Colonel Sturt had
seemed to think they might be doing it, Cousin
Greta had not agreed with him.</p>

<p>Joey set to work to see if she could remember
the signalling; if the Professor were really keen
on it, and went on being in the pleasant temper
he had shown to-night, perhaps she might ask
him some questions.</p>

<p>Dash, dash, dash, dot, dot. She went through
the alphabet; there were no letters like that;
then it must be a numeral. John had taught
those as well. The long numerals were the ones
he had insisted on, because he thought it made
things so slow to have to signal f&mdash;i&mdash;before you
sent a numeral.</p>

<p>Dot, dot, dot, dash, dash&mdash;Joey had it: it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span>
was three. And immediately after it&mdash;a pause
between&mdash;dot, dash, dash, dash, dash&mdash;31.
Thirty-one. That had been all. The other signal
had been an answer, and that was a good
deal more puzzling. For surely dot, dash, dash,
dash, stood for J and dot-dash for A, and yet <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</span>
had no sense. Joey supposed she must have forgotten
the alphabet, and went to sleep at last,
trying to remember.</p>

<p>The play influenced her dreams more strongly
than the signalling. It acted itself again through
her sleep, only it refused to act itself straightforwardly.
Everything and everyone seemed to
stick and repeat, including Noreen&mdash;so ready of
tongue. Her German, which Joey, who had
never learnt any, had so admired last night, had
quite deserted her; the only word she seemed able
to make use of was <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</i>. No "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Tod und Teufels</span>."
No "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ach Himmels</span>." She said, "<span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</span>! <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">ja</span>!" and
that was all, and then the dressing-bell sounded,
and Clara the housemaid came in with a clatter
of cans, and it was morning.</p>

<p>Joey was sleepy, and did not get up till the
last possible minute; and then it meant a frantic
scramble to get dressed in time, and no chance of
talking to the others.</p>

<p>As it was, she was just a moment late, but
grace had not yet been said, for the girls were
still standing round the tables, so she hoped to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[Pg 172]</a></span>
escape the order mark which was her due. She
slid noiselessly into her place, and then became
aware that Miss Conyngham was speaking&mdash;Miss
Conyngham, who never appeared at breakfast,
but had it in a stately manner, befitting
Head Mistresses, in her own room. She was
standing at the top of the long centre table, where
Ingrid and other great seniors sat, and there was
a little line drawn between her eyebrows, as
though she were worried. She was evidently in
the middle of a sentence. Joey listened, trying
to make out what it was all about.</p>

<p>"... And when Professor Trouville went to
the Lab before breakfast this morning somebody
had been there, breaking bottles, mixing
specimens, and doing other acts of altogether
stupid and unreasonable mischief. The door was
as usual locked; the girl, whoever she was, had
got in at the window by the steps, which Professor
Trouville had for once left open. That
being so, I quite exonerate the juniors; no girl
under thirteen could scramble up to that window.
Professor Trouville tells me that he has had
trouble with several of the girls in Remove II.
B; if any girl there has done this wrong and foolish
thing, it is up to her to own it now&mdash;for
the honour of a school which does not turn out
cowards."</p>

<p>There was a thrilling pause, while Miss Conyngham's<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[Pg 173]</a></span>
far-seeing eyes looked round expectantly,
and the Professor stood just behind her,
silent, watchful, impassive, with half-closed lids.
Miss Conyngham seemed to have no doubt that
somebody was going to speak&mdash;a little of the
colour faded from her face and the light from her
eyes, when there came only silence.</p>

<p>"I trust the girl who has done this thing to
tell us now," she said.</p>

<p>And still there was silence.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham's face grew a little stern.
"If any girl here knows anything of the matter,
though not herself responsible, I wish her to
speak out."</p>

<p>Still silence. The Professor whispered something
to Miss Conyngham; she shook her head,
then spoke to the senior mistress present:</p>

<p>"Breakfast had better go on now, Miss Wrestow;
I will deal with this matter later."</p>

<p>She went out, followed by the Professor.</p>

<p>"What on earth is the matter?" Joey whispered,
squeezing hastily into a place by Noreen.
"Something happened to the Lab&mdash;what luck
for you stinks people! You won't be able to do
any."</p>

<p>Noreen was rather cross. "Don't be such a
young silly; don't you see this is going to be a
horrid plague for us? That old beast has put the
Head on to Remove II. B just because he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[Pg 174]</a></span>
doesn't like me, I believe, and of course we're suspected.
You heard what Miss Conyngham said."</p>

<p>"But who's done what?"</p>

<p>"Somebody's got in and smashed some of his
hateful old things there; <em>I</em> should think the cat
as likely as not; but of course he fastens it on to
us. Just like him. As if I'd go and do a silly
kid's trick like that!"</p>

<p>"Of course you wouldn't. It's a shame," comforted
Joey. "But of course the Head would
never think so. S'pose she just had to ask.
When does he think we did it?"</p>

<p>"Last night. He thought we were excited
about the play and aiming it at him, and somebody
went in and did it after we were supposed
to be in bed."</p>

<p>"But he was there himself much later than
that," almost shouted Joey. "I saw him out of
my window."</p>

<p>"Well, he <em>is</em> the limit, then. Let's tell Gabby
that."</p>

<p>The information was passed up to Gabrielle
at the other end of the table; she came round
to the other two the minute breakfast was over.
"What's this, Joey?"</p>

<p>Joey began upon the story of last night, but
hadn't got far in it before Ingrid Latimer bore
down upon the group. "Joey Graham, where<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[Pg 175]</a></span>
are you? You are to go to Miss Conyngham at
once. She told me so before she went."</p>

<p>"Oh, bother! Just when you were telling us,"
Noreen broke out. "Cut along, and do hurry.
I shall burst if I don't know the rest before First
Lesson."</p>

<p>Joey ran, arriving at Miss Conyngham's door
in a decidedly breathless condition.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham was there with the Professor.
He was speaking, but stopped as Joey came in.
Joey had an idea that behind his pale, impassive
face he was very angry.</p>

<p>"Jocelyn," said Miss Conyngham gravely, "I
want to ask you one or two questions by yourself."</p>

<p>"Yes, Miss Conyngham," Joey answered
wonderingly.</p>

<p>"Have you gone outside at night? Think before
you speak."</p>

<p>That question did not need thinking about;
Joey remembered that home-sick first night far
too vividly to hesitate. "Yes, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>"When?"</p>

<p>"The first night I was here. I got out on the
roof; didn't Matron tell you I spoilt my quilt?
She jolly well takes care to go on telling me&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"Answer only my questions, please. You got
out on the roof that first night. For what reason?"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[Pg 176]</a></span></p>

<p>Joey could not say that Noreen, Syb, and Barbara
had been horrid to her; she turned red and
hesitated. The Professor glanced quickly at
Miss Conyngham.</p>

<p>"For what reason, Jocelyn?"</p>

<p>"Oh, just I wanted to. Of course, I didn't
know it was going to rain on my quilt."</p>

<p>"Never mind the quilt. How often have you
done it since?"</p>

<p>"Never, Miss Conyngham."</p>

<p>The Professor's black eyebrows lifted just a
shade. Joey saw them and felt angry. Didn't he
believe her?</p>

<p>"You are quite sure of that, Jocelyn?"</p>

<p>"Yes&mdash;honour."</p>

<p>"Last night," Miss Conyngham said slowly,
her eyes on Joey's face, "the Professor saw a
girl, a tall, slim girl in a short frock, climb in at
the window of the Laboratory sometime after you
were all supposed to be in bed, but before the
servants had locked up. He was not near enough
to be quite sure about her&mdash;but this morning he
found this handkerchief under the window."</p>

<p>She held out the handkerchief&mdash;a small blue-bordered
one, rather grubby. Joey's name, in
Mums' marking-ink, stared up at her from one
corner. It was certainly hers&mdash;it was, in fact, the
handkerchief she had used last night; she remembered
drying her hands with it after helping Barbara<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[Pg 177]</a></span>
to carry the cauldron of boiling water across
the stage. She had thrust it back into her sleeve,
she remembered, when Noreen demanded she
should tell the audience how many syllables the
charade had.</p>

<p>"Yes; it's mine all right&mdash;but I don't know
how it got there," she said, staring at it.</p>

<p>"Is there anything that you would like to say
to me quite alone?" Miss Conyngham asked her.</p>

<p>"You don't think I went to the Lab when I've
said I didn't? I don't tell lies," Joey flared.</p>

<p>"No, I believe your word of honour, Jocelyn,"
Miss Conyngham said, and she looked very
straight at the Professor.</p>

<p>Joey heaved a sigh of relief. "Well, that's all
right. Thanks awfully. Do you want me any
more, Miss Conyngham, or can I go now? For
Noreen and Gabby are frightfully keen to hear
about the things I saw last night."</p>

<p>She turned to the Professor. "I say, were you
walking round the place all the time between
ten and twelve? You must have got wet! If it
had been one of us, we'd have caught it from
Matron for staying out in the rain."</p>

<p>"What do you talk of? I picked up the handkerchief,
suspecting not-ting, and returned to the
Lodge," the Professor said annihilatingly. "It
was not till I visit the Laboratory to make a
leetle experiment this morning, that I find my<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[Pg 178]</a></span>
eyes haf not deceive me&mdash;and then I looked at the
name on the handkerchief, and learn who do me
this injury."</p>

<p>"I've told Miss Conyngham I didn't go into
the Lab," Joey declared, growing angry in her
turn. "I haven't been near the place since you
were so frightfully cross with me for tidying the
day I came. And you needn't be surprised that
I thought you were walking about all that time,
for you were there at twelve, when you were signalling.
I saw you. I dare say you came back
to do it&mdash;only, it was a natural thing for me to
think, wasn't it?&mdash;not rudeness, like doubting a
person's word. I'm sorry if <em>I've</em> been rude,
though; and I think you signal splendidly&mdash;so
jolly fast. I couldn't keep up with you."</p>

<p>The Professor made a contemptuous gesture
with his hands, stained and blunted at the fingertips.</p>

<p>"She dreams, this child. I haf no knowledge
of the signalling. But for the other matter,
Madame, may I ask that you will question further?"</p>

<p>"No, Professor, I shall not do that," Miss
Conyngham said firmly. "Jocelyn has given me
her word of honour that she had no hand in the
matter, and I trust my girls. Someone else
must have taken her handkerchief by accident.
I need hardly tell you that I shall look most<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[Pg 179]</a></span>
carefully into the business and discover the culprit;
but I cannot act as you suggest, or disbelieve
the word of a child who has always shown
herself truthful. Jocelyn, you may go; I am
satisfied with what you have told me; but until
the mystery is cleared up there will be no leave
out for any Redlands girl, and you may tell the
girls so."</p>

<p>"Not for the match?" cried Joey, in dismay.</p>

<p>"Not for the match; except, of course, for the
players," Miss Conyngham said quite decidedly.
"Someone is behaving like a dishonourable coward,
and until she owns up the whole school must
be punished. That will do, Jocelyn."</p>

<p>The Professor made a quick step towards Miss
Conyngham. His expression made Joey think
of the day he had found her trying to perform
the duties of a "scholarship kid."</p>

<p>"If the word of the young lady is to be taken
before mine, Miss Conyngham, I must ask you
of your goodness to seek another Professor of
Chemistry," he said. "And it would be much
to my convenience if you could find him by the
end of dis vairy month, since your young ladies
here haf no desire to learn of me&mdash;and I therefore
receive insults on all sides...."</p>

<p>"Run away, Jocelyn," Miss Conyngham ordered,
and Joey obeyed of course, though it was
a tantalising moment to be ordered out. Would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>
Miss Conyngham and the Professor make friends
again, she wondered, or would she accept his resignation
and let him leave them as he asked to do
by the end of the month?</p>

<p>The end of the month&mdash;why, that would be
the 31st, of course. Joey thought of Noreen's
words, "We're living in a mystery." Noreen
had been joking, but it began to look as though
her joking words were coming true.</p>

<p>It was then it occurred to her that the minute
the ban on going out was removed, the person
to consult was John. But meantime the school
was under arrest and the culprit had still to be
found. Joey made her way back to the others,
and announced Miss Conyngham's depressing
ultimatum on the way to Remove II. B classroom.
By Break the whole school knew it, and
the Head of the Upper School and the Head of
the Lower met for a council of war.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="16">XVI</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Eve of the Match</small></h2>

<p>It was the thirtieth of October, the eve of
the great match between the "Lincs Ladies"
and Redlands.</p>

<p>Ordinarily all Redlands would have been in
a perfect fizzle of excitement; the Team was
strong, the best, so Miss Lambton and the coach
agreed, that Redlands had run for the past six
years; and the weather was perfect, fine and dry
and windy, so that the field at Deeping Royal
was safe to be in the best of all possible conditions
for the match.</p>

<p>But despite all this, gloom reigned throughout
Redlands, from Ingrid down to little Tiddles;
who, although she could not understand the
issues, could at least understand that her adored
Joey was sad.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham had not budged one inch
from her pronouncement, in spite of all that the
College dared to urge. The Professor had seen
a girl climbing in at the window of the Lab, and
yet no girl had come forward to own to it. Until
the culprit gave herself up voluntarily, the whole<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span>
school must be under punishment. And the
punishment was "gating" at all times except the
walks in "croc." That meant that no Redlands
girl, with the exception of the Team, who naturally
must be exempt, could go to the great match.</p>

<p>The College groaned and conjectured and
groaned again. It gave Miss Conyngham up
as a bad job; gentle though she was, she was
harder to move than "Maddy" with her austere
manner, or Miss Wrestow, the senior mistress,
with her strict views on discipline. It tackled
understanding people, like Miss Craigie and Miss
Lambton, and implored intervention. But nothing
made any difference; Miss Conyngham had
given her ultimatum, and by that the school had
to abide. Until the culprit gave herself up, the
whole of Redlands was under the ban.</p>

<p>Joey sometimes wondered if she were still suspected,
in spite of her emphatic denial and Miss
Conyngham's apparent acceptance of it. She
knew that the Professor had suspected her; Ingrid
had been sure that he whispered her name
to Miss Conyngham when she came in late on
that dreadful morning, and the look in his eyes
had been so vindictive, Ingrid said, that he must
have really wanted to get her severely punished,
perhaps even sent away. Ingrid had been very
indignant about it, and championed Joey so publicly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>
that no one in the College would have dared
to doubt her.</p>

<p>Besides at first everyone was sure that the
clearing up of the mystery was only a matter
of a few hours, or, at the most, a few days.
Ingrid called a meeting of the Upper School;
Gabrielle of the Lower. Both pointed out with
proper Head-Girl firmness that the offender was
bound in honour to come forward&mdash;and no one
did! And that second half of October went slipping
away, with the College still under its ban
and the mystery unsolved.</p>

<p>The suspense began to get upon everybody's
nerves, and excitable people started to cast accusations
about, more or less wildly. It did no
good, and only wore still thinner the already thin
patience of the girls. And the thirtieth came,
and still the criminal was undiscovered and the
College paying in bitterness of spirit for her
silence.</p>

<p>Joey was trying to forget the trouble in the
kindergarten with the babies. They, in especial
little Tiddles, were always so proud and pleased
to have her there that she snatched half an hour
with them whenever she could manage it, despite
the remonstrances of Noreen, Syb, and Barbara,
who thought her tastes eccentric and "not the
thing" for Remove II. B.</p>

<p>Of course they could not be expected to realise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">[Pg 184]</a></span>
that Joey missed Kirsty and Bingo quite badly
sometimes, for the public attitude of Redlands
towards juniors at one's home was studiously detached.
Syb wrote to her small sister every
week, Joey knew, and sent her a present costing
three weeks' pocket-money on her birthday, but
when asked about her didn't know whether she
was nine or ten, and could only state vaguely
that she "believed it wasn't a bad sort of kid."</p>

<p>So Joey refrained from saying too much about
Kirsty and Bingo, but stuck firmly to her friendship
with the kindergarten people all the same.</p>

<p>When Noreen burst into the kindergarten
play-room during the half-hour between tea and
prep, Joey only thought her friend had come to
drag her away, and went on defiantly with
"Oranges and Lemons."</p>

<p>But instead of the good-natured jeer which
she expected, Noreen spoke quite hoarsely:</p>

<p>"Come along, Joey; I want you."</p>

<p>Joey looked at her. Noreen was very white,
and her blue eyes were blazing. Clearly something
was very wrong.</p>

<p>"I want you," she repeated. "Do leave the
babies and come along."</p>

<p>There was an expostulatory wail from the little
ones. Joey turned round and hugged Tiddles,
who was nearest to her, clinging to her djibbah
in readiness for the tug of war.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[Pg 185]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can't stop now, darling; but I'll tell you
what, I'll come after tea to-morrow, as we can't
go to the match."</p>

<p>Tiddles released her unwillingly, and Noreen
seized her arm and dragged her off at once.</p>

<p>"What <em>is</em> the matter?" Joey asked, as soon as
they were outside the room and out of hearing
of the babies.</p>

<p>Noreen gave a short laugh.</p>

<p>"You'll never guess. It is about the limit.
Here have Doris Redburn and Roma Kirke
been insinuating that it was <em>I</em> who broke into the
Lab."</p>

<p>"What? You!" gasped Joey.</p>

<p>"They said I was always grousing about
stinks and saying how I hated the Professor&mdash;of
course, that's a true bill. And they said I
didn't care what rows I got into. That's a true
bill as well. I don't care. I rather wish I had
done that Lab business&mdash;only Gabrielle is so stuffy
about things like that&mdash;but if I had, I simply
<em>couldn't</em> hold my tongue and have the whole Coll
punished, even if telling meant getting expelled."</p>

<p>"Of course you couldn't," Joey burst out, furious
for her friend. "Who are saying it&mdash;Doris
and Roma? I'll just go and tell them what I
think about their hateful untruthful cheek...."</p>

<p>"No, stop!" Noreen cried, catching her arm
as she whirled by. "It's no good just going<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[Pg 186]</a></span>
for those two&mdash;they say lots of girls think it.
Wonder if Miss Conyngham does too?"</p>

<p>"'Course not!" said Joey hotly. "She'd jolly
well know you couldn't be a mean outsider, whatever
else you might be. But I do wish the Professor
hadn't gone and stirred her up like this.
If he hadn't been so cock-sure he saw a girl, it
might have been supposed to be the cat."</p>

<p>Noreen groaned.</p>

<p>"It's pretty beastly anyway. One of our
crowd is behaving like a rotten outsider, and her
rotten outsiderishness is being fastened upon me.
It is rough luck."</p>

<p>Joey had never seen her cheerful and inconsequent
friend half so "down"; she was dreadfully
distressed.</p>

<p>"Let me just go for that Doris girl&mdash;she's
much the worst," she suggested.</p>

<p>"What's the good?" asked Noreen dejectedly.</p>

<p>She put her arm through Joey's, and they began
to walk up and down the broad gravel path
between the house and the Lab.</p>

<p>"Why on earth couldn't the Professor go to
bed and stay there, instead of messing round and
spoiling the hockey-match for us all? I'm jolly
glad he's leaving at the end of the month," she
concluded vindictively; "but he's done the harm
by now."</p>

<p>"If only he hadn't been so sure about the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[Pg 187]</a></span>
girl," Joey repeated, frowning. "It's that makes
Miss Conyngham so stiff about it&mdash;otherwise
she'd just take our words."</p>

<p>"I think she ought to, anyway. Just think
of the match, and Redlands perhaps pulling it
off for the first time for six years, and not one
of us there!"</p>

<p>"P'r'aps the girl will own up in time," Joey
suggested, but not hopefully.</p>

<p>Noreen shook her head.</p>

<p>"Not she. She would have done it long ago if
she meant to. She's probably a beastly slacker,
who doesn't care two pins about hockey...."</p>

<p>"Nor the Coll," Joey added gloomily.</p>

<p>"I've a good mind to go to the match after all&mdash;are
you game, Joey?" Noreen said suddenly.
"Oh yes, I know there'll be the father and
mother, not to mention the aunts and uncles of
a good old row; but one may just as well be
hanged for a sheep as a lamb. If they're going
to suspect me of beastly things like this&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>Noreen was driven rather desperate; that was
clear. Joey held on tighter to her arm, as though
she expected her to bolt off there and then.</p>

<p>"It would be heavenly, Noreen; but we can't&mdash;you
know we can't. Besides, everyone's dying
to go."</p>

<p>"If I could get hold of that skunk of a girl!"
growled Noreen, and then her eyes lit up again<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[Pg 188]</a></span>
with a dangerous gleam. "Tell you what, Joey;
I've a precious good mind to say I did do it after
all; and then the others will be allowed to go
anyway."</p>

<p>"Noreen!" gasped Joey.</p>

<p>"Oh, of course. I shall tell Miss Conyngham
that I didn't&mdash;afterwards&mdash;when it's too late to
matter. You're right about the other thing; it
would be rather skunkish when everyone is dying
to go. But I'd give them the chance this way.
Oh, I know it's an awful thumper, but they
shouldn't put it into my head by hinting that I
did the crime and lay low."</p>

<p>"No one would believe you did it," Joey
urged, grasping at a straw. "No one to count,
at least&mdash;who cares for silly idiots like Doris and
Roma?"</p>

<p>"Wouldn't they? I've got a truly Irish reputation
here."</p>

<p>"Well, no one could believe you wouldn't tell
for a whole fortnight when everyone was being
punished, anyway."</p>

<p>"Doris and Roma hinted that quite a lot of
people found it easy enough to believe," Noreen
said bitterly. "No, shut it, Joey; I've settled,
I'm going to do it. You ought to be pleased;
you'll be able to go to your cousin's again&mdash;didn't
you say they'd asked you for Sunday?"</p>

<p>"Don't be a pig, Noreen!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[Pg 189]</a></span></p>

<p>"Pax, old thing, I didn't mean it. Of course,
you won't like my doing it, I know; but it <em>is</em> a
way out. Get Gabrielle to take Syb for her
other friend if she will; Syb's wild to go...."</p>

<p>"Noreen, will you promise, honour! not to
go telling Miss Conyngham you were the one
till after Prep at least?" poor Joey urged in desperation.
"Oh, do promise, Noreen."</p>

<p>"What's the good of waiting, you cuckoo?"</p>

<p>"Oh, the real girl might speak&mdash;or I might
find a way out."</p>

<p>"The cheek of you! Because you got a scholarship,
you think...."</p>

<p>"Oh, talk sense, Noreen; of course I don't.
Only I might find a way. Promise!"</p>

<p>"Righto. Till after Prep, then, but not a
minute longer. Understand."</p>

<p>Noreen disengaged her arm, and departed
hastily. Joey stood still considering. Everything
that was in her revolted against Noreen's
plan; and yet what was there to do? Even her
inherent hopefulness found it hard to believe that
the culprit would come forward at this eleventh
hour, and if she didn't&mdash;the guests of the Team
were all held up for the match, and the gating
of the whole College might go on for an indefinite
period&mdash;possibly even to the end of the term.</p>

<p>Joey had herself already realised the practical
drawbacks of the punishment: she had received<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[Pg 190]</a></span>
a particularly kind letter from Cousin Greta
asking her for the day next Sunday, and Miss
Conyngham had said, "Write and decline."</p>

<p>Of course it was nothing in comparison with
the match; still, now Cousin Greta had been so
nice and understanding about her reprehensible
proceedings on the former visit, she would have
quite liked to go again. Besides, she wanted to
ask John about the Professor's signalling. And
yet to allow Noreen to tell a lie and accuse herself
of an act of unforgivable meanness&mdash;that
couldn't be right.</p>

<p>Joey looked up at the Lab; if only the Professor
had not been so wide awake that night!
She supposed he was quite sure of what he saw;
after all, it was a very dark night. And then
there came to Joey the bold thought of going to
ask the Professor if he were really quite sure.
He was in the Lab; she could see his head moving
between wall and window, and there would
be just time before the bell rang for Prep. Joey
made one dart for the steps, and hammered at
the door.</p>

<p>"Please, it's not anyone come to worry you
when you're busy," she called out. "I'm Joey
Graham, and I want to ask something dreadfully
important, but it will only take about half a
sec."</p>

<p>There were steps inside the Lab; a key turned,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[Pg 191]</a></span>
the door opened. The Professor stood there before
her, dressed in the long white linen coat he
wore when he was working. The violet handkerchief
protruded from one pocket.</p>

<p>"May I come in just a moment?" Joey asked
humbly. "I want to ask you...."</p>

<p>"I am very busy," the Professor told her, in
no very promising voice.</p>

<p>"Well, but it's frightfully important," Joey
tumbled out in desperate haste for fear he should
shut the door in her face. "If I could help you
clearing up or anything like that after, to make
up for wasting your time now, I would like a
shot if you'd let me, but...."</p>

<p>"Ah, it is of course the scholarship girl that
tink she has the duty to tidy here," said the Professor.
His temper seemed to have suddenly improved.
"You may come in, and tell me vat it
is you vish to say."</p>

<p>Joey came in. Even in that supreme moment
she noticed that the Lab looked very much as
though it needed tidying. The Professor saw her
glance.</p>

<p>"Dere is so much that I must do to make all
in readiness for my successor," he said blandly.</p>

<p>"Is he coming at once?" Joey asked.</p>

<p>"In two, tree days after I have left; <em>I</em> go
away to-morrow, and, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ma foi</i>! I tink I must
be again up 'alf de night to prepare the Lab for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[Pg 192]</a></span>
him. So if you tink you see me signalling
again...."</p>

<p>"I shan't be startled," Joey finished for him.
"But I wasn't really before&mdash;it's only Tiddles
and babies like that who are frightened of you,
and they're so little, you know; they can't help
it. But I wanted to ask you about that night&mdash;it
was jolly dark, you know; that's partly why
your signalling was so beautifully plain&mdash;do you
think you might just possibly have been mistaken
... about the girl you saw?..."</p>

<p>"You tink I make de lie, <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">hein</span>?" the Professor
asked.</p>

<p>"Oh <em>no</em>, of course not," Joey assured him in
a great hurry. "You're French, you know, and
French people would be just as much the soul of
honour as English, <em>of course</em>. It's only Huns
who tell lies, one knows. Only it <em>was</em> a very dark
night, and Redlands girls always have owned up
about things before&mdash;and it's so desperate about
being stopped from the match and all, you know,
that Noreen O'Hara&mdash;the one whom you call
'Fathead' in Stinks Class&mdash;is going to say she
did it, though she didn't, for the sake of the rest
and one can't let her do that, can one?"</p>

<p>"An' I am to prevent Mees O'Hara from telling
de lie&mdash;by the vay, it seems it is not only
Huns dat do dat after all&mdash;by telling Mees Conyngham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[Pg 193]</a></span>
that I consider myself mistake'?" the
Professor said slowly.</p>

<p>"Of course not, if you're dead sure about the
girl," Joey corrected miserably. "Only, it <em>was</em>
dark, wasn't it? I was looking out of my window
all the time, so I know how dark it was; and
if you said <em>you</em> weren't quite sure, I know Miss
Conyngham would rather believe a Redlands girl
wasn't a mean outsider."</p>

<p>The Professor lifted his heavy lids and looked
at her.</p>

<p>"You are a good pleader, Mees Joey Graham.
So you looked from your bedroom for long and
tink it too dark for me to see clear. I will go to
Mees Conyngham now&mdash;and tell 'er dat I may
'ave been mistake'&mdash;on one condition&mdash;dat you
do as you offer a while back and come to-morrow
to 'elp me tidy de Lab. Ees dat a bargain? since
I waste my time on preventing your Mees Noreen
make de lie."</p>

<p>"Rather!" Joey cried joyfully. "I say, you
<em>are</em> a good sort, and you shall just see how I'll
tidy to-morrow. I suppose you wouldn't like me
to bring Gabrielle and Noreen as well? I'm sure
they would be most awfully pleased."</p>

<p>"No!" the Professor said sharply. "Bring no
one, and tell no one. I do not want children running
in and out; they disturb me."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[Pg 194]</a></span></p>

<p>"All right," Joey promised joyfully. "When
shall I come?"</p>

<p>"At twelve, when you haf finished lessons,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n'est-ce pas</i>?" the Professor said, quite pleasantly
for him, and Joey, with a heartfelt "Thank you,"
flew for her classroom at her best speed, arriving
late, in company with two or three other
laggards.</p>

<p>"Really, Jocelyn Graham, and you, Bernadine
and Rhoda, you are too bad," Miss Lambton
said indignantly. "Why can't you listen for
the bell, instead of coming in late and disturbing
us all in this way? Take a Rule, all three of
you; and don't let it happen again."</p>

<p>The "Sorry, Miss Lambton," which Joey murmured
was conventional entirely. She was
not sorry at all, for she had a glorious conviction
that the deed was done, and the College
cleared.</p>

<p>Bernadine, Rhoda, and herself were kept behind,
when Prep was over, to receive a short but
stringent lecture from Miss Lambton on the need
of punctuality, and so did not go out to dress
with the rest. But the attention which Joey was
endeavouring to give to Miss Lambton was much
interfered with by conjectures, and scattered
altogether by a sound that came a minute or
two later down to Classroom Remove II. B&mdash;a
sound of cheering.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Louder it grew and louder, as girls came pouring
in from their different classrooms.</p>

<p>"What <em>can</em> be happening?" Miss Lambton interrupted
herself to ask.</p>

<p>The three sinners took the question for a signal
of dismissal. They ran.</p>

<p>A great throng of girls, growing larger every
moment, was congregated in the hall, cheering
wildly. Squeezing past smaller girls, and under
the elbows of seniors, Joey arrived somehow in
the front rank.</p>

<p>A large notice faced her&mdash;a notice on which
the ink was hardly dry:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>"In consequence of information received,
Miss Conyngham withdraws the ban on
Redlands."</p>

<small class="small-caps">Tricked</small></h2>

<p>Joey was up next morning with a punctuality
that highly exasperated the other occupants
of Blue Dorm. But in the face of so
much excitement, she would have found it almost
impossible to stay in bed, even if she had
not wanted to telephone to Cousin Greta before
breakfast, to ask if after all she might go to her
on Sunday.</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham had given gracious permission
for the use of the 'phone overnight, and if
Joey was to be at the Lab at 12, she would not
have a minute to spare, most likely, till the match
was over. And this was Saturday.</p>

<p>She leaned far out of her window first thing
to see if the weather was smiling on the all-important
match. It was quite fine and clear, with
a sky that looked a long way off slightly flecked
with fine mares' tails, and a sea that seemed comparatively
near, lying silver grey on the luminous
horizon.</p>

<p>"Oh, get back to bed," groaned Noreen, from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span>
half under the bedclothes; but Joey got up, all
the same, and dashed downstairs to the 'phone.</p>

<p>The housemaids had just finished with Miss
Conyngham's room and were sweeping the hall;
Joey shut the door to get away from the dust
and noise, and asked for Colonel Sturt's number
at the Exchange.</p>

<p>She got it; but it was an unfamiliar voice that
answered her:</p>

<p>"Her ladyship is not yet down, and cannot be
disturbed."</p>

<p>"Is Miss Grace there?" asked Joey.</p>

<p>"Miss Grace is not yet down."</p>

<p>"Is anybody?" Joey asked, hoping sincerely
that she would not be obliged to talk to Colonel
Sturt.</p>

<p>"Mr. John is, miss; would you wish to speak to
him?"</p>

<p>"Please," Joey said, relieved; and a minute
later heard the heavy thump of crutches, and a
decorous voice saying, "A young lady to speak
to you, sir."</p>

<p>Joey squeezed the receiver vigorously. "That
you, John? It's Joey speaking. Can you really
walk about now? How topping!"</p>

<p>"Yes, rather&mdash;I'm getting along fine with
crutches," was John's cheerful answer. "I say,
why can't you come on Sunday, young 'un?
You'll find Gracie quite different this time...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span></p>

<p>"I can come now, if Cousin Greta doesn't mind
my changing," Joey explained. "The Coll got
gated, and now it's un-gated, that's all; and I'm
going to the match at Deeping Royal this afternoon,
and I'd like to come over to you to-morrow
no end if I may, and tell you about it."</p>

<p>"Righto. I'll tell my aunt. She'll be awfully
pleased. You may take it she'll fetch you for
lunch. I say, like to do some more signalling?"</p>

<p>"Oh yes, John. Do you know our Stinks Professor
here is frightfully good at that? I saw
him the other night...."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em> Don't you go to bed at night at Redlands?"</p>

<p>"Of course, you stupid. The Professor was
doing it at night, not me. I saw him out of my
window."</p>

<p>"Signalling practice all by himself in the middle
of the night? Tell that to someone younger,
my dear Kid."</p>

<p>Joey took no notice of the jeer. "John, isn't
dot, dash, dash, dash, J?" she demanded.</p>

<p>"Yes, rather!"</p>

<p>"And dot-dash is A?"</p>

<p>"Of course."</p>

<p>"Then what does <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</span> spell?"</p>

<p>"All by itself?"</p>

<p>"All by itself."</p>

<p>"It's the German for yes," John told her, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span>
a second's pause. "But your Stinks man is
French, isn't he?"</p>

<p>"Yes; Professor Trouville."</p>

<p>"Was that <em>all</em> his signalling you saw?"</p>

<p>"That wasn't his signalling."</p>

<p>"Whose was it?"</p>

<p>"I don't know. It seemed to come from a
long way off."</p>

<p>"You said the Professor signalled?"</p>

<p>"Yes; he did first."</p>

<p>"What?"</p>

<p>"It seemed like 31."</p>

<p>"Thirty-one?"</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"Funny&mdash;that's to-day," John said. "Joey."</p>

<p>"Yes."</p>

<p>"I think you had better come over here; I'll
ask Cousin Greta to send for you. Come to-day,
I mean, and not wait for to-morrow."</p>

<p>"<em>John?</em> I can't to-day&mdash;it's the match."</p>

<p>"Well, I'll take you on to it in the car."</p>

<p>"It's frightfully nice of you&mdash;but, you see, I
was going with Gabby and Noreen, my specialist
friends."</p>

<p>"I'll ask Aunt Greta to ask the whole boiling
of you to lunch then," John said, impatiently.
"So long, Joey. I can't tell you any more till I
know it myself. But you come along if you're
sent for."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span></p>

<p>"But, John, I can't come to lunch, because
I've promised to tidy the Lab," Joey began, and
then stopped, because she had been rung off. She
went in to breakfast, feeling very doubtful
whether she wanted to go to lunch at Mote to-day,
even with the company of Noreen and Gabrielle.
It would be much more fun to go with
the Team, and it was more than possible that
Cousin Greta might not see the great importance
of being in time for the match.</p>

<p>Then Miss Conyngham made an announcement
at breakfast that made her absolutely sure
she did not want to go.</p>

<p>"I am glad to know that it seems possible I
suspected a Redlands girl unjustly," Miss Conyngham
said in the clear voice that reached without
effort to every corner of the big refectory.</p>

<p>"Because I am so glad and thankful that I
<em>was</em> mistaken, I wish to give the College an especial
treat, and therefore arranged last night by
'phone that enough brakes should be here by 1.15
to-day to take the whole six hundred of us to
Deeping Royal&mdash;to see, we hope, Redlands pull
it off against the Lincs Ladies."</p>

<p>Miss Conyngham might have had more to say,
but she was not allowed to say it. The whole
school rose at her, and the cheering, as Noreen
remarked afterwards, nearly smashed all the
breakfast-cups on the table. Miss Conyngham<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span>
had to hold up her hand twice for silence before
she could mention that dinner would be at a
quarter to one, promptly, to allow of a punctual
start for Deeping Royal.</p>

<p>"How absolutely topping of the Head,"
Noreen whispered to Joey. "I say, I <em>am</em> glad
you stopped me making an ass of myself last
night. I believe she's just as bucked about it
as we are, really. Bags I next place to you, old
thing, in our bus."</p>

<p>"I'm not going," Joey explained mournfully.</p>

<p>"Not going?"</p>

<p>"Not with the rest, I mean. I've got to go
to lunch with my cousin."</p>

<p>"What rot! You can't. Why, we should have
no end of a time driving&mdash;you go quite close to
the Stakes by the shore of the Wash."</p>

<p>Joey began to wish very acutely that she had
rung up Mote again directly she was cut off,
and explained that she couldn't manage Saturday.
Only John had startled her just for a minute;
he had seemed so oddly sure that she must
come, and then the breakfast gong had gone,
and it was too late.</p>

<p>"Absolute rubbish," Noreen persisted. "Gabby,
do you hear? Joey wants to lunch with her
cousins and go with them instead of with us."</p>

<p>"I don't want&mdash;at all," poor Joey said. "Only&mdash;John
seemed to want me...."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span></p>

<p>"The conceit of the kid," laughed Barbara.</p>

<p>"I mean he wanted me about signalling, I
think," Joey explained in a hurry.</p>

<p>"Oh, tell him signalling must jolly well wait.
Get the Head to let you 'phone," advised Barbara,
and Joey got up from table with every intention
of taking her advice. But, when she
found herself in the passage leading to Miss Conyngham's
room, the rather urgent note in John's
voice haunted her. He had seemed to think it
mattered that she should come to lunch to-day,
and he had been so very kind in teaching her to
signal. And if for some odd inexplicable reason
it should matter, it would be so poor and un-English
to have stayed away just because it
would be more fun going with the others. After
all, Noreen, who was nearly a year older than
herself, had suggested there was some mystery
going; and though she had said it half jokingly,
it might be true all the same. She must put up
with the duller drive, and not even ask if Noreen
and Gabrielle might come with her to Mote; it
was quite clear they would not want to. Joey
gave herself a little shake and marched up to Miss
Conyngham's door.</p>

<p>"Please, Cousin Greta asked me to lunch to-day,
at least John spoke, and they'll send and
take me to the match afterwards, if it's all right,"
she said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Miss Conyngham was very busy, and hardly
looked up. Joey half hoped she would say "Why
do they want you?" and then she would have explained
about the signalling, and the Head might
have said it did not matter. As it was, she only
glanced up from her papers for the fraction of a
second.</p>

<p>"Yes, you will enjoy that, Jocelyn. Get
ready in good time; don't keep your cousin waiting.
That will do."</p>

<p>Joey went back to the others to explain briefly
to several disapproving friends that she had not
asked the Head's leave to decline the invitation.</p>

<p>"You're a silly juggins," Noreen stated, with
candour. "But if it's done, it's done, I suppose:
the Head would never stand being bothered
again. Only mind you're not late&mdash;you'll spoil
the match for Gabrielle and me if you are, remember."</p>

<p>"I won't be," Joey promised.</p>

<p>She was off to the Lab on the stroke of twelve.
She did not suppose that Cousin Greta would
send for her till nearly 1.30, as her lunch was
not till 1.45; but there had been a great deal
of tidying to do, and she must leave ten minutes
for getting into her best frock, and brushing hair
and nails. There wasn't a moment to lose.</p>

<p>As she ran round the corner of the great
house, she noticed that the mares' tails of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span>
morning were spreading fast over the sky.
"There's going to be a lot of wind presently,"
she thought, and that was all she did think about
it just then, for the work she had to get done by
1.15 was decidedly uppermost in her mind,
mingled with that little under current of surprise
that John should be so interested in the Professor's
signalling.</p>

<p>But just as she came within sight of the Lab
she had to stop, for there was little Tiddles, walking
solemnly along by herself, not seeming to
mind for once that she was near the Professor's
lair, and crying, not aloud as the babies did usually,
but with the tears rolling slowly down her
tiny cheeks.</p>

<p>In spite of her hurry Joey had to try and comfort
the poor mite. "What is it, darling?"</p>

<p>Tiddles looked mournfully at her. "They
won't let me go this afternoon," she said, with a
sob. "They say Tiddles has a cold; but it will
make her cold more ill to stay at home."</p>

<p>"Oh poor Tiddles!" sympathised Joey.
"What frightfully hard lines. But I'll tell you
all about it afterwards, darling; and it is a long
drive, you know, quite nine miles, and it gets
awfully cold in the late afternoon."</p>

<p>"You could cuddle Tiddles tight in your arms,
Jo-ey; then she would not catch cold," Tiddles
declared.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[Pg 205]</a></span></p>

<p>"But I'm not going with the brakes, duckie, so
I couldn't hold you," Joey said.</p>

<p>"You are going to stay at home and play with
Tiddles?" asked the mite, with dawning hope.</p>

<p>Joey shook her head, though she felt very unkind.
"No, pet; but I'll tell you everything&mdash;Honour!
and play with you to-morrow instead."</p>

<p>"Won't you play with her now, Jo-ey?" Tiddles
pleaded. She had a quaint way of speaking,
as though she were a personality quite distinct
from the Tiddles whom the College petted and
treated as a baby.</p>

<p>"I can't, darling; I have to go in there," Joey
nodded in the direction of the Lab. "And you
must let me go now, for I have to be busy."</p>

<p>Tiddles let go of her hand without a word, and
stood looking after her with brimming eyes, but
without actually crying. Joey felt a brute to
leave her like that, but it had to be done. It was
already nearly ten minutes past twelve; the Professor
would be waiting for her.</p>

<p>He was. She saw that directly he unlocked the
door to her, as quickly as though he had been
standing just inside. His face was less impassive
than usual, and it had a slightly yellowish look,
while the eyes upon which Gabrielle had commented
were strained. But the face relaxed a
little at the sight of Joey. "You are late! I
feared you would not come," he said.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[Pg 206]</a></span></p>

<p>"I'm so sorry; I just got kept by poor little
Tiddles&mdash;she was crying," Joey explained. She
did not wait to tell him why; the Professor did
not care for children, and would not want to
know she thought.</p>

<p>"Ah, de Belgian baby dat fear me," said the
Professor, showing his teeth in a curious smile.
"It is a strange idea you schoolgirls have of me,
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">n'est-ce pas</i>? To one I am an expert signaller&mdash;to
another a fierce ogre."</p>

<p>"We all think you were frightfully decent
though to square it with Miss Conyngham,"
Joey said, with conviction. "Do you know we
are all going to the match&mdash;all the school! It's
never been known before."</p>

<p>"Yes, I know dat," the Professor said. "You
all go, mistresses and all at 1.15; except for
you."</p>

<p>"Did <em>you</em> know I was going to my cousin's?"
Joey asked surprised. She had never thought
Professor Trouville would take half so much interest
in what the schoolgirls did. He had never
seemed to think anything about them, except that
they were very stupid at chemistry.</p>

<p>However, she had no time for wondering.
"Please, where would you like me to start tidying?"
she asked, looking round the big, untidy
place.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[Pg 207]</a></span></p>

<p>The Professor was bending over something on
the table&mdash;a little square wooden box, into which
he appeared to be fitting a small glass tube with
care. He did not even look up.</p>

<p>"I need many bottles from the closet," he said.</p>

<p>"Shall I get them?" asked Joey politely.</p>

<p>She dived into the innermost recesses of the
closet. As she did so she heard quick steps across
the floor, and the closet door slammed, making
the place quite dark.</p>

<p>Joey was startled by the suddenness of the slam
and darkness; but she dared not move for fear
of stumbling over the bottles that littered the
floor.</p>

<p>"Oh, please open the door&mdash;I can't see anything,"
she called, and as she called it the key
turned in the lock.</p>

<p>"Don't do that, please; I'm inside," she shouted
at the top of her voice; but even while she called
that fact out confidently there was an unbelievable
fear looking over her shoulder&mdash;she felt she
would see it, if she turned her head&mdash;and the
knowledge that the Professor knew she was there
all the time, and had locked her in on purpose.</p>

<p>She put all the courage that was in her into the
effort to push that horrid thought away.</p>

<p>"If you're playing a trick on me, please stop
it now, because there's a lot of tidying and Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[Pg 208]</a></span>
Conyngham will be fearfully vexed if I haven't
changed my frock before my cousin sends for
me," she urged. "They'll look for me if I'm not
there when the car comes."</p>

<p>She talked into thick darkness and silence.
She could hear the Professor moving about the
room, but he returned no answer at all. She
spoke into a blank wall.</p>

<p>The keyhole was still blocked with the key.
She could see nothing, and what little she heard
gave her no help at all. Still she tried hard to
keep her end up.</p>

<p>"I wish you'd stop it now and let me out," she
said firmly. "If it's a joke you've had the best
of it, and if it's a punishment I should like to
know what I've done. Anyhow, I don't see staying
here."</p>

<p>The Professor came across to the closet; there
was a little rattle, and the keyhole showed light.
He had taken out the key, but he had not turned
it.</p>

<p>Joey darted to the door as soon as that little
ray of pale wintry daylight showed her where
it was. She saw the Professor busily engaged in
fitting the little wooden box into a cigar case
that seemed made for it. His white linen coat
had covered a neat dark tweed suit of undoubtedly
English make; his moustache was gone.
She saw that in the moment before he walked<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>
quietly past the locked and keyless door of the
dark closet, and out through the outer door of the
Lab, which he locked behind him. Joey had seen
that he was smiling a little.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="18">XVIII</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">At Deeping Royal</small></h2>

<p>Cook, though amazingly capable, was not
an absolute magician; few people are. Perhaps
it was not altogether astonishing, considering
that she had only received her orders last
night when dinner had been duly ordered, that
the meal was not on the table quite at 12.45. It
was in fact seven minutes late&mdash;not an extraordinary
delay considering the circumstances, but
enough to make the meal a scramble, and everybody
feel a little fussed.</p>

<p>Noreen and Gabrielle had both meant to see
Joey before she started, and impress on her the
great importance of not allowing her cousin to
start late for Deeping Royal. But Joey was not
to be seen about the place when they put on coats,
boots, and hats according to directions before
lunch, in Remove II. Dressing-Room, and there
was not a second to tear up to Blue Dorm, where
she would be changing into her Sunday frock,
when lunch was over. Everybody was bustled
into the brakes in hot haste, with the exception of
poor Tiddles, who was being consoled, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[Pg 211]</a></span>
by lunch with the housekeeper in her own room,
and a liberal supply of sweet biscuits and almonds
and raisins.</p>

<p>"Rotten about Joey not coming with us,"
grumbled Noreen, as the long procession of
brakes wound down the drive. "I can't think
why she wanted to go to her cousin's to-day of
all days."</p>

<p>"She didn't," Gabrielle remarked. "Joey does
a few things she doesn't want."</p>

<p>"Well, it's very tiresome she should do it to-day.
I bet she'll be late, and then she'll have to
stand somewhere at the back, and we shan't be
together at all."</p>

<p>"We could go back a little way to meet her,"
suggested Gabrielle, "and then whatever happens,
we shall be together."</p>

<p>"Good egg! What luck you're Lower School
Head, Gabby! If it were me I should have to
ask leave, and probably get it refused too,"
Noreen whispered, for Miss Lambton was in the
brake with them, and she was young and great
on discipline, and was known to disapprove of
some among the many concessions made to Gabrielle's
exalted position. It was on the cards
that, if she heard the plan, there would come an
authoritative order to keep all together and not
exert the privileges of Head of the Lower School.</p>

<p>The drive was a long one, but no one in the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span>
whole school thought so for an instant. Besides
the grand excitement of the match at the far
end, the drive itself was so full of interest.</p>

<p>After passing the station the long procession
of brakes kept to the straight raised road for a
couple of miles only, then began to wind down
on to the broad road which spanned the Deeps.</p>

<p>That road in itself spelt romance to the Redlands
girls. It was still christened <em>Malfrey
Street</em>, though that Roger Malfrey, who had
owned the chief interest in the flourishing town
and harbour that had once made Deeping Royal
a famous name in the region of the great Wash,
and had sunk a fortune and years and high hopes
in the attempt to make a lasting road across the
undrained fens, had gone&mdash;where effort that has
failed may wear a brighter crown than fulfilment.</p>

<p>Now, centuries later, sand and shoals had
silted up the harbour, and of the old greatness
of Deeping Royal nothing remained but the magnificent
twin churches of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Philip and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr>
James (once hardly able to contain all the worshippers
of the place), and open fields that
carried strange names&mdash;"Fishmarket Field,"
"Mummers' Square," "Gold-Heart Street," and
so on. Of Deeping Royal proper there remained
a straggling fishing village of, perhaps, five hundred
souls.</p>

<p>Malfrey Street ran in a line with the river for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
three-quarters of its length. A quarter of a mile
perhaps of Green Deeps separated the brimming,
bankless river from the causeway that lifted itself
from the grass even as the river seemed trying
to do. And both seemed making straight as
a die for the sea. Then, when Redlands was
some seven miles behind, river and road appeared
to change their minds, and, twisting
sharply, ran parallel with the flat, dreary shore
for more than two miles, only a narrow strip of
shingle dividing the sand from the road. On
such a day as this the road was soft with the sand
that blew over the shingle and settled on it, only
to be whirled away and flung among the coarse
grass that still struggled to grow between river
and road&mdash;fighting for existence with sea-pinks
and purple madder.</p>

<p>The sand blew into the girls' eyes and proved
rather a bar to absolute enjoyment at this point.
The mares' tails of the morning were driving
madly across a high, ragged sky; the wind had
come with a vengeance.</p>

<p>"Bother it!" growled Noreen, pushing her
curly ends of hair out of her eyes for about the
hundredth time. No plait that was made could
keep Noreen's curly hair in absolute order.
"Hard luck on the teams to have such a wind as
this."</p>

<p>"It's equally bad for both, anyway," Gabrielle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[Pg 214]</a></span>
remarked. "And I'd back our side for pluck
anywhere."</p>

<p>Miss Lambton was looking uneasily at the sky.
"I hope it won't get much worse," she said.</p>

<p>But Gabrielle and Noreen had an optimistic
spirit about a team captained by the great Ingrid
Latimer, and refused to be really depressed
by the weather on their account.</p>

<p>It was another fear which worried them.</p>

<p>"Suppose that cousin of Joey's thinks it's too
bad to play, and won't send her?" Noreen whispered
tragically.</p>

<p>"I believe she'll come somehow&mdash;trust her,"
Gabrielle whispered back reassuringly. "Anyhow,
we'll go as far as the reservoir, and see.
If we climb up at the side of that we can get a
splendid view."</p>

<p>By this time they were within a quarter of a
mile of Deeping Royal. To their left was still
the desolate shore, with the narrow strip of
shingle separating them from it, but there was a
great sense of nearness to the waves which the
high wind was driving in big and threatening,
with a crest of foam.</p>

<p>Before them, crowning the slight rise on which
the village stood, were the great twin churches,
standing not a stone's-throw apart, with their
massive beacon-towers outlined sharply against a
clear, wind-swept space in the sky.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[Pg 215]</a></span></p>

<p>Below them clustered the village, through
which the procession of brakes drove up a rather
steep street to the inn, which one reached through
an incongruous ivy-hung gateway, bearing on
one mouldering dim red pillar the name cut
deeply "Good Hope."</p>

<p>The "sweet Anne Wendover," whom Roger
Malfrey had wooed in vain, because "the wasting
sickness" wooed her more successfully, had lived
there; and he must have ridden often through
those great gates, which now stood wide to <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chars-&agrave;-bancs</i>
and brakes all the summer-time, and bore
a large printed notice, "Teas provided."</p>

<p>"Joey would like this," whispered Gabrielle,
as the first brake rattled into the old court-yard,
and stood beneath the new sign.</p>

<p>"Yes, wouldn't she? Queer how one misses
the kid," returned Noreen. "Specially queer
when one remembers how we barred her coming
from that twopenny-half-penny school."</p>

<p>"A man's a man for a' that," quoted Gabrielle.
"We were snobs."</p>

<p>"You weren't anyway. Well, it's over and
done with. Hope she won't be late."</p>

<p>"So do I," observed Mademoiselle de Lavernais,
with a suddenness which took the two rather
aback. They had not realised that she was so
near, or that she would take the smallest interest
in their conversation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[Pg 216]</a></span></p>

<p>It had, in fact, been a surprise to everyone
that "Maddy" should have come at all. She had
never professed to take any interest in the school
games, or in the life outside her classes. But
she had turned up to-day at the hurried lunch,
in her rusty black toque, and her coat and skirt
of a cut belonging to some five years back, and
had climbed into the same brake as Noreen and
Gabrielle.</p>

<p>The two turned to her politely as soon as she
joined in their conversation. "May we see if
we can get you a good place, Mademoiselle?"
Gabrielle asked; "and then we are going to try
and keep one for Joey."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle smiled, her little tight-lipped
smile, that seemed as though it were a thing stiff
from disuse.</p>

<p>"Thank you, my child; I am obliged. But I
fear I do not come to view the match, though it
will give much pleasure to hear of the success of
Redlands, I assure you. But the hockey is to me
a mystery, and I seek a sketch of this place that
may remind me of the fen-land when I no more
see it."</p>

<p>Noreen stared. "But&mdash;but&mdash;are you going
away?"</p>

<p>Mademoiselle smiled again. "Yes, after this
term I return no more. So think no further of
me, but watch for your friend."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[Pg 217]</a></span></p>

<p>She detached a little field-glass case that was
slung across her narrow shoulders. "Take these
if you will, and you will see her from afar."</p>

<p>"But won't you want them, Mademoiselle?"
asked Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"Not yet, my child; I shall sketch first. Presently,
if I can drag my old bones so far, I climb
one of the twin towers that I may see the great
view, which is to live in my heart also. You will
bring them back before I need them. Adieu."</p>

<p>Gabrielle took the glasses gratefully. "Jolly
decent of her," she whispered to Noreen, as the
procession of girls began to wind their way out of
the inn-yard, and down through the village towards
Fishmarket Field, where the great match
was to be played.</p>

<p>The wind was now terrifically high, a regular
gale blowing straight from the sea. "Lucky they
didn't bring Tiddles; the poor mite would have
been scared out of her senses by all those great
waves so close," Noreen said. "I wonder when
high tide is, Gabby. It must be pretty near that
now I should think."</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked out towards the sea. "I
should think it must be. Someone told me high
tide never comes beyond that bit of broken harbour
wall, and it's up to it now."</p>

<p>"If it ever <em>does</em> come over, I should think Fishmarket
Square is an enormous puddle," laughed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[Pg 218]</a></span>
Noreen. "I don't see any sign of the Lincs
Ladies in the field. Do you? Suppose we're
early."</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked at her watch. Noreen's spent
most of its time at the nearest jeweller's being repaired!</p>

<p>"Yes, nearly a quarter before time; we might
have chased Joey to Blue Dorm after all. Let's
go along to meet her."</p>

<p>"One of the church towers would be a good
place for sighting her," suggested Noreen; "but
then we shouldn't be able to lay hold. So the
road be it. Hope her cousin won't want to hang
on to her by the way; we don't yearn to have
the whole show tacked on to us."</p>

<p>"I don't suppose she'll come," Gabrielle said;
"Lady Greta, I mean. She'll just send Joey in
the car. She'll know we shall bring her back all
right."</p>

<p>"I see. We just grab Joey, and say, 'Home,
James,' haughtily to the chauffeur. Come on."</p>

<p>They slipped away unnoticed from the throng
of girls at the entrance to Fishmarket Field,
and made the best of their pace to the road, setting
out along it at a steady double. The reservoir
was nearly three-quarters of a mile away,
but Noreen had come in first in the Hundred
Yards Race for over-fourteens-under-sixteens at
the College Sports in the summer, and Gabrielle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
was a quick though not a lasting runner. The
reservoir was reached in an easy six minutes;
and they began to scramble up its high bank.
The wind caught at their clothes; it seemed trying
to whirl them bodily away. Noreen stopped
for breath; Gabrielle caught her arm.</p>

<p>Then, "Try-the-other-side-against-the-wind,"
she shouted; "wind-might-blow-us-into-water-here."</p>

<p>Noreen had plenty of sense when she chose
to use it; she nodded, and the two slithered
down the rough brickwork, and dived around to
the farther side so as to face that furious wind
driving from the sea. They clambered up the
bank, and Noreen, who reached the top first,
crouched gasping and laughing, with her hat
crushed under her arm, and her hair blowing
wildly.</p>

<p>"Oh, I shall be blown clean off," she shouted
down to her friend. "Come and help me hold
on, Gabby; or give me Maddy's glasses."</p>

<p>Gabrielle, who was wrestling with her hat, had
no hand free, and Noreen leant down and
snatched the glasses from her.</p>

<p>"Yes, there's a car," she proclaimed. "Can't
see what it is, or how many people in; but it
seems to be doing a sprint all right. Bother
that cyclist in front&mdash;he gets in the way."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">[Pg 220]</a></span></p>

<p>"The car will catch him up directly though,"
said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"It's a motor-cycle, stupid! My word!
They're coming some pace."</p>

<p>"Which, the car people?"</p>

<p>"Both. Come up and look. Your turn with
the glasses. I'll have just one more squint
through them. My Sunday hat, and...."</p>

<p>"What is it?" demanded Gabrielle, scrambling
up in a hurry, for Noreen had broken off short in
her favourite ejaculation, as though she were almost
too surprised to speak. "Isn't it Joey in
the car?"</p>

<p>"Who do you think it is on the motor-cycle,
and scorching fit to bust?" demanded Noreen in
a thrilling whisper. "Why, our old Stinks Professor,
no less."</p>

<p>She suddenly dived down from her position on
the high-bricked bank, and dropped below, pulling
Gabrielle with her, and nearly landing on
terra firma with a great bump, in her haste.</p>

<p>"He won't have seen us; <em>he</em> hasn't got glasses.
Let's hide and perk up like jacks in the box just
as he goes by. He'll have the surprise of his life&mdash;and
he ought to be pleased to see two of his
promising pupils."</p>

<p>"You won't call out or anything to give him
a jump, will you?" asked Gabrielle anxiously.
She knew Noreen.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">[Pg 221]</a></span></p>

<p>"Am I a juggins? He'd probably jump out
of his skin and break his precious neck," Noreen
said. "I only want to say a suitable good-bye
to one who never bothered to say it to any of
us, I noticed."</p>

<p>Her eyes brimming over with mischief, she
caught Gabrielle's hand and dragged her round
to the angle of the reservoir, still keeping the
side farthest from the sea. "Now let's shin up
this&mdash;more rest for our toes at the corner," she
said; "then we can put our heads over the top,
and, speaking with extraordinary politeness&mdash;oh,
it's all right, Gabby&mdash;mention that the brainiest
and the stupidest girl in Remove II. are
desirous to bid him a fond farewell. What's the
harm of that?"</p>

<p>"We shall miss Joey," objected Gabrielle. "I
don't mean to do that for any Professor."</p>

<p>Noreen, who was scrambling up the angle of
the reservoir, kicking vigorously to find a foot-hold,
managed to rear her head enough to look
over the top for a second.</p>

<p>"Nor do I, as it happens, but we shan't," she
stated. "If it's a race, the Professor means to
win, hands down."</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="19">XIX</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">Against Time</small></h2>

<p>Joey had shouted till she was hoarse; she had
flung her inconsiderable weight upon the
door again and again in the hope of forcing it&mdash;a
feat performed with misleading ease in all
Gavin's books of adventure.</p>

<p>She had to stop at last from sheer exhaustion,
and then it was, when there was nothing else to
do, that she began to think.</p>

<p>The Professor had locked her in, though she
had called to him. So he had known that she
was there. He was not deaf, so he had locked
her in on purpose. That was the first thought
which came at all clearly to her mind. The second
was more puzzling still&mdash;why had he done
it? Joey never knew exactly at what moment it
was that a suspicion about the Professor crossed
her mind. Her mind had travelled quite a long
way first&mdash;as far as Mote. What would Cousin
Greta say when the car came back without her?
Oh, but it wouldn't&mdash;somebody would look for
her. Yes, they would look, but would they look
in the right place, for no one knew where she<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">[Pg 223]</a></span>
had gone&mdash;no one but little Tiddles? All the
girls would have gone by the time Cousin Greta's
car came for her. Syb and Barbara most likely,
and Gabrielle and Noreen most certainly, would
never have given up hunting for her if she were
missing in a mysterious way; but then they were
her friends. The maids were very kind and
good-natured&mdash;they would look for her in the
Blue Dorm and the playroom, and one or two
more likely places of that kind, but it was not to
be expected they would go on looking after that.</p>

<p>They would probably think she had changed
her mind, and gone off in one of the brakes, and
tell Cousin Greta's chauffeur so. He would go
back to Mote without her, and Cousin Greta
would think her a girl who had been even ruder
than on the former occasion, with less excuse;
and John would think her a slacker, which was
worse. Joey felt despairingly miserable at the
thought of John's contempt; and with that misery
came naturally the thought why John had
wanted her to come to-day. She was not very
clear as to the reason herself; but it was certainly
something to do with the Professor's signalling.
And somewhere at that point a suspicion lifted
its head.</p>

<p>Joey groped for a box in the darkness, and sat
down to consider. All kinds of queer things
about the Professor kept shifting in a muddled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">[Pg 224]</a></span>
kaleidoscopic whirl across her memory&mdash;his curious
anger on the first day they had met, the afternoon
when she had tried to perform the duties
of a scholarship kid by tidying the Lab; the violet
handkerchief he used, with the queer marks
on it; his prowls and signalling at night.</p>

<p>Sitting there in the darkness, with her fingers
pressed tightly on her eyeballs to help her to
think, Joey saw again that handkerchief hung
out to dry upon the nursery guard of the First
Form Room, and the little yellow marks that
came out with the heat, and disappeared when
the handkerchief was cool again. They might
just have been washing marks&mdash;if washing marks
ever did a thing like that.</p>

<p>Joey pressed so hard upon her eyeballs that
she saw violet stars instead of handkerchiefs, and
then, in the midst, she saw again distinctly those
funny little marks which had shown themselves
between the red-worked initials of the Professor's
name, &mdash;.&mdash;...&mdash;</p>

<p>Dash, dot, dash, and dot, dot, dot, dash&mdash;that
was Morse, and it spelt two letters, K and V.
What could they stand for? The Professor's
name was Achille, so he had informed Noreen,
when, greatly daring, she had inquired one day a
week or so back, after a particularly peaceful
"stinks" class, when she had not been addressed
as Fathead. Besides, what person in their senses<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">[Pg 225]</a></span>
would have a name first worked, and then fixed
on in some kind of invisible ink, and in Morse?</p>

<p>K V! K stood for Kenneth or Kitten or Kultur,
or Kamerad, or Kaiser. (It was odd how
many German words came unbidden to her
mind.) And V might be Vauxhall or Vaterland!
Yes, Vaterland was spelt with a V,
though it sounded as if it were an F. Joey found
that the two words Kaiser and Vaterland fixed
themselves in her mind, and joined together with
John's odd tone about the signalling, and the
Professor's midnight expedition, and that lettering
that she had read&mdash;the figures&mdash;31, and then
the answer <i lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</i>. The 31st was to-day, and <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</span>, as
Noreen had used it in the wonderful charade,
meant Yes. What was going to happen to-day,
and who had answered the Professor's signal?</p>

<p>Joey's mind went back slowly over the ground
of this exciting month at Redlands, till it reached
that Sunday spent at Mote, when she had come
back to school alone, and been caught by the sea-roke,
and had taken shelter in the Round Tower.
The jumpy young man had certainly been doing
odd things down below, and he had not been at
all pleased to see her there at first; that was certain,
though he had been quite kind and nice afterwards,
and told such interesting stories. It
had never occurred to Joey that the stories might<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">[Pg 226]</a></span>
have been intended to have a deterrent effect
upon her.</p>

<p>But could the young man's obvious jumpiness
have anything to do with the mysterious business?
Noreen had thought so, but Joey hoped
it hadn't, for if it were he who had answered <span lang="de" xml:lang="de">Ja</span>
it meant he was a German, and she didn't want
him to be that. It was much easier to think
of the Professor as a German; Joey had rather
liked the young man, in spite of a slight natural
contempt for his nervousness. And then, quite
suddenly it all came over her; a sense of some
great danger, which was none the less frightful,
but rather the more, because it was all so vague.</p>

<p>Colonel Sturt had thought that Germans were
creeping back into the country&mdash;Germans in no
way altered by the wars, inside. And they were
clever, everyone knew that&mdash;quite clever enough
to call themselves French, and talk with a French
accent that was good enough to take people in.
Suppose she were right in what she guessed, and
the Professor was not French at all but German,
what was he doing in the school Lab? And what
had he taken away with him from the Lab this
31st October, when the only person who could
see what he was doing was locked into the closet,
and likely to remain there till the girls came home
from the match, and a proper search was instituted?
Joey remembered that curious little box<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">[Pg 227]</a></span>
which through the keyhole she had seen the Professor
fit so carefully into his cigar case. It was
not only something precious to him, but it was
something he did not wish anybody else to see.
And if he were a German, it was something that
no one must see, because it was something that
would do harm&mdash;not just to an insignificant person
like herself, but to England. When Joey
thought that she had to hold herself in, hard; or
she would have flung herself upon the door, and
beaten upon it in a frenzy till she was worn out.
For everybody who might look for her was away,
and no one knew anything except her imprisoned
self; and the Professor was probably away by
now with the mysterious box, putting every minute
more distance between himself and Redlands.</p>

<p>But she forced herself to keep cool. She
would want all her powers if she was to do any
good.</p>

<p>She had heard the great clock from the old
clock tower strike one quite a long time ago;
yes, the School would have started. And there
was not the tiniest bit of a window in her prison;
it was all dark and close and filled with bottles
that rattled and fell over if she moved, and boxes
with sharp corners that cut her shins.</p>

<p>Mingled with the other stuffy smells there was
the rank smell of newly fallen plaster. Though
it was dry enough now there had been a good deal<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
of rain last week, and Noreen had mentioned
casually that the Professor had been very cross
because some rain came through the closet roof
and spoilt one of his "preparations."</p>

<p>Joey stood up cautiously, and, crouching on the
floor, felt for the fallen plaster, groping before
her with both hands. Of course she banged her
head against a shelf, and upset a bottle, which
smelt overpoweringly, but she found the plaster,
and stood up again considering. Somewhere
there must be a tile off; and if one had gone, she
could surely pull away more, and attract attention
from above.</p>

<p>Only how did one get up there? Shelves, of
course! Joey cleared a space on the lowest shelf,
as well as she could in the darkness, and scrambled
on to it, clinging to the one above. There
was a crash and the tinkle of broken glass, but
she was reckless now. It didn't matter if she
smashed all the bottles in the "Stinks Shop," as
long as she got out before it was too late.</p>

<p>Hanging on with one hand, she pushed away
some bottle from the next shelf, and pulled herself
up on to it; and so, with much bruised shins,
she landed at the top and stood upright, the roof
in her reach at last.</p>

<p>She had expected to find a hole through which
she could put her hand, but she actually only felt
a cold whistle of wind, and had to pick at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span>
lath and plaster for a good five minutes in the
darkness before she could see any light through,
and then only a chink.</p>

<p>She pushed with all her might, but nothing
happened. There was a great shrieking and
whistling above her head, and she realised that
the wind must be rising; but nothing happened
for all her efforts. She had thought that when
one tile was off the others would follow naturally,
but it seemed that only happened when you didn't
want it to do so.</p>

<p>She must have something to push with&mdash;a shoe
would do, only she must remember to put it on
again before she stepped down upon the broken
glass strewing the floor.</p>

<p>Joey unlaced one of her strong shoes, not without
upsetting another bottle in the process, and,
standing on tiptoe on the top shelf, began a violent
assault upon the breach in the roof. If she
could only make a hole large enough to get her
head through, she thought, she would shout and
shout and shout till somebody heard and came to
let her out.</p>

<p>It is very tiring to stand on tiptoe, especially
when one foot has no shoe on, and bang at something
above you. Joey's arms ached and her toes
ached, and her back; the height at which Calgarloch
had stood amazed was hardly enough for her
purpose; she had to stretch to her utmost capacity.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span>
"Lucky it wasn't Gabrielle who got
shut up," she thought to herself, and then,
through all her anxiety and struggling, came
the thought of her two friends, Noreen and Gabrielle,
and the plans they had made together for
the afternoon. What were they doing now?
Joey wondered. Were they remembering to look
out for her? Yes, she felt sure they would do
that; they were the kind of friends who stood by
you. If only she had them to stand by her now!</p>

<p>Her attack on the roof did not appear to have
any effect but that of bringing down unwanted
showers of plaster that made her choke and
sneeze and, more than once, gave her a nasty
knock. But she kept on doggedly at her task&mdash;she
had to do it somehow. English people
couldn't wait to ask whether the job was do-able
when your country wanted it done. And all
the time she was imprisoned here the Professor
was free to do what harm he liked, because nobody
knew about him but herself.</p>

<p>Joey redoubled her efforts, and a tile went at
last. She could hear it fall on to the ground below.
One gone&mdash;perhaps the next would be
easier. She dropped her tired arms for a moment
to rest them, and in that moment the big
clock struck two. Only half an hour to the time
the match would start&mdash;that gave her a fresh
sense of urgent need of haste. She smashed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">[Pg 231]</a></span>
furiously at the roof, and her shoe went through
it and stuck so fast that she nearly came off the
narrow shelf in her effort to dislodge it. In spite
of her anxiety and her aching arms, she had to
giggle at the thought of how absurd a shoe must
look from below, sticking up through a hole in
the roof.</p>

<p>It came away at last, and something happened
at the same moment: there were steps outside
and the key turned in the lock&mdash;somebody was
coming in.</p>

<p>Joey shouted at the full pitch of her lungs, as
she tumbled down recklessly from the shelf and
hopped across the broken glass to the door.</p>

<p>"Oh, let me out! I'm shut in."</p>

<p>There was an exclamation, and the voice of
Frances, the superior parlour-maid who had
opened the door to Joey on her arrival, called,
"There, Miss Tiddles! You were right&mdash;she
<em>was</em> here."</p>

<p>A key slipped about in the lock of the closet
door. "Miss Jocelyn, what have you done with
the key?" Frances demanded.</p>

<p>Hope died in Joey's heart. "The Professor
took it."</p>

<p>"I think he's just gone," Frances said. "I'll
try this key again; the locks are nearly the same."</p>

<p>"Oh, Frances, do try, like a brick!" poor Joey
cried in a frenzy. The Professor only just gone;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>
there might be time to stop him yet. Fennell
the gardener was a large man, and he was probably
somewhere about the place.</p>

<p>The key rattled, half-turned, stopped.
"Bother!" cried Frances. "Run, Miss Tiddles,
there's a dear, and see if the Professor's gone
yet."</p>

<p>Wonder of wonders. Tiddles must be in or
near the Lab&mdash;Tiddles who had such a horror
of it. But Joey had not time for astonishment.
"Stop her! Don't let her go!" she cried. If
the Professor knew that she was escaping from
her prison!</p>

<p>Frances seemed to be bending all her powers
to the turning of the key. She was a determined
person, accustomed to resisting the onslaughts of
the Lower School upon the sugar basin, when
she poured out the tea. "Almost got it&mdash;there!"
she said, with a gasp.</p>

<p>The key wheezed and turned; the door opened&mdash;Joey
was free. "<em>Thank you</em>, Frances!" she
gasped, and fled past Frances, past little Tiddles
standing solemn-eyed and scared at the top of
the Lab steps, and away towards the house. She
had put on her other shoe while Frances was
wrestling with the key; but it was a dirty, hatless
girl, with torn stockings and scratched hands, who
flung herself round the angle of the house, as
the steadily decreasing throb, throb of a motor-bicycle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
announced that the Professor was making
full speed down the drive, and out to the
world beyond.</p>

<p>Joey did not call the gardener. The Professor
had gone; he would be no good now. She
dashed through the side door, and fled like the
wind to Miss Conyngham's room. It would be
empty now, of course; there never was such an
emptiness anywhere as there was about the College
to-day. But the telephone was there, and
the telephone was what she wanted just now.
John was the one person she could think of as
able and willing to help; one wouldn't go to
Frances with an unsupported story like hers.
Frances would look at you as though she was
thinking "Not another lump&mdash;one is plenty, Miss
Jocelyn," and there would be an end of it. But
John would understand.</p>

<p>She put the call through with feverish haste,
and a hand that shook a little. Her knees were
trembling too, and her mouth was dry, but it did
not strike her that she had had no dinner. Other
things were mattering so much.</p>

<p>A maid's voice answered her. "Can I speak
to Mr. John Sturt?" Joey asked, trying to sound
ordinary and business-like. "Oh&mdash;would you
give him a message and say it's dreadfully important,
please? Say I'm coming, and I don't think
the Professor is French after all&mdash;he'll know&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
he's just gone off in a tearing hurry, and he
took things from the Lab in his cigar case, and
he's on a motorbike, and he locked me in." Joey
jammed on the receiver, and, without waiting to
get coat or hat, fled out of the front door and
down the drive. She hoped Miss Conyngham
wouldn't be very vexed by what she was going
to do; but anyhow she would have to do it. She
set out running through the iron gates and along
that straight marsh road, along which the Professor
must have gone first. She had forgotten
to ask that a car should be sent to fetch her, but
somehow she had no doubt that would be done.
Only, she could not wait.</p>

<p>Her faith in John was justified. John must
have beaten all speed limits. She hadn't run a
mile, battling with the fierce side-wind that
seemed to take all her breath away, when a cloud
of dust in front of her, resolved itself into a long-nosed
grey racing-car; there was a rending
screech, and John's voice hailed her.</p>

<p>"Good! Thought I'd meet you; jump in.
Mind my crutches."</p>

<p>Joey scrambled up, and he backed and turned
the car neatly. "Did you meet him?" she demanded
breathlessly.</p>

<p>"Who? The Professor? No."</p>

<p>"Didn't you? I thought he'd go to the station<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">[Pg 235]</a></span>
or something," Joey said blankly. "John,
I believe he's a German in disguise."</p>

<p>"Bright Kid," John agreed. "I 'phoned to
the Police Station before coming to meet you,
but we could do with some more information.
What's this about his locking you in?"</p>

<p>Joey told breathless reams, without a single
comma.</p>

<p>John whistled. "H'm! Now, where's the
beggar gone?&mdash;that's the question."</p>

<p>The car had reached the point where the roads
branched, to the right to Mote Deep Station and
so on to the Grange; to the left towards the sea
and Deeping Royal.</p>

<p>"If he only left just before you 'phoned I
ought to have met him," mused John. "There
isn't a train for three-quarters of an hour&mdash;and
you bet a Hun knew that&mdash;they're so thorough.
He must have gone to the Junction, and then he
would pass Mote, of course."</p>

<p>"Think he went to have a squint at the hockey
match?" suggested Joey doubtfully. John shook
his head at her, more in sorrow than in anger.</p>

<p>"Joey! Joey! Think I left my distracted relations
in the middle of lunch, and brought my own
special and particular car, just sent me by the
Governor&mdash;you shall see all her points later on
when we've settled this little affair&mdash;to hear you
making cracked suggestions like that. If our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">[Pg 236]</a></span>
gentleman is out for mischief, he won't be specially
keen to locate himself in the midst of a
large crowd of astute Redlanders, you bet. Stand
up in the seat&mdash;hold on to my shoulder, that's
sound enough, and see if you can locate him
anywhere."</p>

<p>Joey obeyed. She was breathless with excitement,
and though John had jeered at her suggestion
about Deeping Royal, he had certainly
seemed impressed by her story, particularly by
the violet handkerchief and the box packed in the
fat cigar case. Of course, one would expect a
big boy of seventeen, in naval uniform, to laugh
at a girl of only thirteen; he wouldn't be human
if he didn't.</p>

<p>She got upon the driving seat, holding to
John's shoulder with one hand and trying to clear
her hair out of her eyes with the other. The wind
was furious; she found it quite hard to keep her
footing, though John's car was low&mdash;a typical
racer, if she had known more about cars. John's
father had known his son's taste to a nicety; John
wasn't out for ornament.</p>

<p>She saw the twisted chimneys of Mote Grange
far away, and the corrugated iron roof of the
station in the foreground. Then she looked
along the road to the left.</p>

<p>Clear in the intensely clear atmosphere that
often goes with furious wind, she saw the twin<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">[Pg 237]</a></span>
towers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Philip and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James standing
against the grey line of the sea. But not one
thought did she give to the great match that
would be starting there in a very few minutes
from now; for not so very far away, upon the
white raised road, a figure was on foot beside a
motor-bicycle, pushing it, running with it&mdash;<em>on
foot</em>!</p>

<p>She grabbed John's shoulder. "Oh, John,
I'm sure it's him&mdash;the Professor&mdash;and his bicycle
won't go, or something."</p>

<p>"By Jove!" John cried. He glanced up
at Joey with a grin. "I suppose I ought to scoot
to Mote and get help, and drop you in Aunt
Greta's charge."</p>

<p>"John! he'd get away!" shrieked Joey.</p>

<p>John grinned again. "He probably would.
We won't do what we ought. Get down, Kid.
I'm going to let her rip."</p>

<p>Speed record certainly did not concern John
just then&mdash;the long-snouted racer leapt forward,
bumping wildly with the pace which John got
out of her.</p>

<p>Joey crouched low in the car, feeling as though
her hair was being torn from her head, but
blissfully happy all the same. She had absolute
confidence in John; he would deal with the Professor.
It did not occur to her that seventeen-year-old
John on crutches might not be a match<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">[Pg 238]</a></span>
for a determined man in perfect health. Her
only fear was that the motor-bicycle might get
going too soon.</p>

<p>There are few bends in a fen road. Those who
made them may have had the roads of Russia
in their minds, for fen roads tend to be drawn
with a ruler from end to end.</p>

<p>They saw the Professor, still struggling with
his bicycle, more than a mile away. They saw
him run pushing his machine, and this time it
fired and went.</p>

<p>Joey said, "Oh!" in deep disappointment.
John grinned again.</p>

<p>"Some race, Joey! Hold tight&mdash;if he can rip,
so can we."</p>

<p>He only spoke once again. "You might loosen
my dirk, Kid; it's your side."</p>

<p>Then he bent himself to the wheel, and got
every inch of speed out of the car that was in
her. The distance between car and bicycle diminished
slowly.</p>

<p>The wind roared and tasted salt to the lips;
the towers of <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> Philip and <abbr title="Saint">St.</abbr> James stood
higher and higher. And now the high parapet
of the reservoir was in sight. When they passed
that, Deeping Royal was not three-quarters of
a mile away.</p>

<p>"He must be going to see the match after all!"
shrieked Joey. She had to scream to run any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span>
chance of being heard above the roar of wind
and the racing, lurching car.</p>

<p>There was still half a mile between car and bicycle
when the bicycle was up to the reservoir,
and the Professor clapped on his brakes, and
dashed for it on foot.</p>

<p>"John!" Joey screamed. The play, which
the occupants of Blue Dorm had acted to celebrate
Miss Craigie's return, rushed suddenly into
her mind. She remembered the box of tiny bottles
hidden in the cigar case, and the thin cruel
smile she had seen on the Professor's face as she
looked at him through the keyhole.</p>

<p>Perhaps John had the same thought in his
mind. The car bumped furiously, and all but
overturned.</p>

<p>The Professor disappeared round the angle of
the reservoir.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="20">XX</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Professor's Drive</small></h2>

<p>It all happened so quickly that there was no
time to think or wonder, hardly time even to
cry out.</p>

<p>Something that looked like a hand, emerging
from a white cuff and a dark coat sleeve, appeared
for one instant above the parapet of the
reservoir just by the angle, and almost the same
instant two heads, surmounted by the close green
hats of the Redlands girls, shot up to one side of
it. The arm waved wildly, and then disappeared
with suddenness below the parapet, the two heads
diving down after it with startling celerity.</p>

<p>If ever John's new car travelled, it travelled
then!</p>

<p>Joey forgot everything else&mdash;the match&mdash;the
roaring furious wind, the sense of cold and hunger&mdash;what
<em>was</em> happening at the reservoir? And
then they were there!</p>

<p>John ran the car into the grass of the roadside;
the reservoir stood a little back from the
road. He brought the car to a standstill, and
grasped the crutches which Joey had ready for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
him. Together they tore round the angle of
the great reservoir, Joey leading.</p>

<p>On the ground below it sat the Professor, one
hand clasping the back of his head. He held
something close in his other hand.</p>

<p>Before him stood Noreen and Gabrielle, the
latter really apologetic, the former certainly inclined
to giggle, though she was making a valiant
effort to restrain herself.</p>

<p>"I'm frightfully sorry we startled you so,"
Noreen was explaining. "We didn't mean to;
we were just watching for Joey, and then we
saw you, and thought it would be fun to take
you by surprise. I never thought we should make
you fall back. Honour! and as to Gabrielle, it
wasn't her plan at all, so you can't blame her."</p>

<p>Noreen's clear carrying voice reached Joey
without any difficulty, as she slipped and
stumbled over the coarse, sandy grass. The Professor
was getting dazedly to his feet while she
was speaking; he did not appear to be much
mollified by her apology.</p>

<p>"You haf giv me de bad fall," he said. "You
haf made me de headache; I cannot smoke...."</p>

<p>He raised his right arm, as though to hurl away
in a temper the thick cigar case that he held. It
was open; he crushed his thick thumb down on
one of the tiny blown-glass bottles that filled it.
Joey gave a leap like a young chamois and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
caught his arm. "The cigar case!" she panted,
and Gabrielle caught it as it dropped from the
Professor's hand in the surprise and shock.</p>

<p>He turned furiously upon Joey. "You!" he
shouted, and flung her violently away from him,
snatching at the little case in Gabby's hand before
she was prepared.</p>

<p>"John!" Joey screamed; but John was finding
it hard going with crutches over the uneven grass,
and he was not yet up with them. The Professor
broke through the little crowd of girls and dashed
for his bicycle. He was on it&mdash;if only it would
refuse to start! No such luck&mdash;he was turning it
in the road&mdash;he was off!</p>

<p>John dropped one crutch, and stooped down.
Next moment his dirk was hurtling through the
air, thrown with an accuracy that just got the
back wheel tyre. John had bowled for Dartmouth.
There was a loud explosion, and bicycle
and Professor were mixed up in a heap on the
road.</p>

<p>"Lucky you loosened the dirk," John said to
Joey, and then they all hurried breathlessly to
their fallen enemy.</p>

<p>The Professor was lying quite still half underneath
his bicycle.</p>

<p>"Is he killed?" asked Gabrielle, in a quiet
awestruck little voice.</p>

<div class="figcenter">
<a name="Illustration_IM_FRIGHTFULLY_SORRY_WE_STARTLED_YOU_SO" id="Illustration_IM_FRIGHTFULLY_SORRY_WE_STARTLED_YOU_SO"><img src="images/startled.jpg" alt="Startled" width="438" height="664" /></a>
<p class="caption">"I'M FRIGHTFULLY SORRY WE STARTLED YOU SO"</p>
</div>

<p>John bent over him, and unbuttoned his waist-coat,
putting his hand inside. "He's only stunned.
Take the case, Joey."<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>The Professor had flung it into his coat pocket;
Joey took it out and gave it to John. He opened
it, and took one of the unbroken bottles out, looking
at it anxiously. "I expect this was what he
worked in the Lab to get done unsuspected."</p>

<p>"Think he's got poisonous germs or something
bottled there?" asked Noreen.</p>

<p>"I'm no chemist; but you bet it's some putrid
game, like spreading a rotten disease by water.
We've got to hand it over to the police any way,
and some bacteriologist will tell us all about it.
But first we'll have this chap into the car. Can
you spare one of those sash things you wear?
We'd better tie his hands behind him, or he'll be
getting away when he comes to."</p>

<p>Three white braid sashes were at once forthcoming;
John took Noreen's, and tied the Professor
up thereby securely.</p>

<p>"Doesn't he look different without his moustache!"
Noreen observed.</p>

<p>"Oh, he's shaved that, has he?" John asked.</p>

<p>"He took it off in the Lab; it wasn't a real
one," Joey explained.</p>

<p>John whistled, and grinned approvingly.</p>

<p>"You saw a fair lot through your keyhole!
Well, I suppose it's pretty clear that our gentleman
was in the habit of altering his appearance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span>
for reasons of his own. Another item in his bill.
But he didn't show the usual Hun attention to
detail&mdash;when he took the key out before he had
finished everything, did he?"</p>

<p>"He thought no one would know where he
was. He forgot Tiddles, I expect," Joey contributed.</p>

<p>John tied the last knot with a flourish, just as
the Professor began to show signs of returning
consciousness.</p>

<p>"Tiddles? Oh, the Belgian baby! Yes, I expect
he forgot her. So she knew you were there."</p>

<p>"Yes; I think she saw my shoe sticking out
of the hole I made in the roof, and fetched
Frances&mdash;the pet!" Joey said. "I say, Gabrielle,
<em>do</em> you think I'll be in a fearful row with Miss
Conyngham again? for I've done dreadful
things in the Lab, besides coming out all untidy."</p>

<p>"I doubt if you'll get it in the neck from your
Miss Conyngham this time," John told her cheeringly.
"But now we must attend to business.
How do you find yourself now, sir? Can you
get into my car, or do you want to be helped
there?"</p>

<p>The Professor for all answer made a struggle
with his hands, but the braid was strong, and
John knew how to tie his knots.</p>

<p>"No go," said John. "You had better come<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span>
quietly. I'm sorry we had to tie you up; but
we'll make you as comfortable as we can."</p>

<p>The Professor regained his breath and his
senses.</p>

<p>"I do not understand dis outrage," he said.
"I shall spik of it to Miss Conyngham instantly.
Dese girls shall be punished...."</p>

<p>"I'm afraid you've cut your cheek a bit," John
said concernedly. "Let me get your handkerchief&mdash;do
you keep it in your pocket or up your
sleeve? It's the violet handkerchief I want, the
one where the code letters come out when you
hold it to the fire&mdash;K V, you know."</p>

<p>The shot went home. "What is this fairy
tale," the Professor asked contemptuously. But
he had paused before he asked it&mdash;the pause had
been perceptible.</p>

<p>"Now will you get into the car, Professor
Trouville," John said politely. "I think you see
that we have some grounds for this&mdash;outrage."</p>

<p>He turned to the girls. "I'll drive you to the
match if you like, and then this gentleman on
to the police station."</p>

<p>The Professor struggled unwillingly to his
feet. Joey looked at Gabrielle and Noreen. The
match had ceased to be of the first importance.</p>

<p>Besides John was very lame; if the Professor
got loose, by any chance, he might need their
help. She turned to Gabrielle. "Do you think<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span>
we might go with John? John, this is Gabrielle,
she's Head of the Lower School and a frightful
knut, and can give leave for all kinds of things.
The other is Noreen, and they're both special
friends."</p>

<p>"Look here," said John to Gabrielle, "I really
think you had better give leave for the three of
you to see the affair through. The circumstances
are exceptional&mdash;and I doubt if there will be
much of a match to-day in this wind, anyhow.
Besides I'll run you back to Deeping Royal before
anyone's missed you, and then you can explain
to your boss."</p>

<p>"Well I think we might, and thank you ever
so much," Gabrielle answered very properly, but
with eyes that sparkled.</p>

<p>"Right!" John said, and then they all bundled
into the car, Professor and all, leaving the damaged
bicycle in the road. It was a terrible
squeeze, of course, to get five into a two-seater;
but much can be done when people are determined.
The Professor, yellow and strained-looking,
was wedged in between John and Gabrielle;
while Joey and Noreen squeezed somehow
into the little emergency seat behind. The
car dashed back along the road they had come.</p>

<p>As they had tucked themselves in Joey noticed
that Noreen's shoes were squelching with wet.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>"Did you sit on the edge and put your feet in
the reservoir?" she asked.</p>

<p>Noreen laughed. "No, but when I wedged
my feet at the angle it seemed to have sprung
a leak. Hush! Don't tell Gabrielle. She'll
probably think we ought to go back like the
Dutch kid, and stop it with a finger."</p>

<p>"I expect it will do all right if we report it
at the police station," Joey said. "But it must
be a healthy leak, if it's made you as wet as all
that."</p>

<p>"It's always happening," explained Noreen,
the experienced. "The reservoir was done with
scamped work in the first instance&mdash;haven't you
heard our beloved Miss Craigie draw a moral for
our benefit? Oh, well, if you haven't, you will.
And they're always having to shore up one bank
or another.... I say, you're shivering; it is
jolly cold for motoring."</p>

<p>John caught the words, and rammed on his
brakes. "What an ass I am! Put on my coat,
Kid."</p>

<p>He began to struggle out of his motor-coat.
His arms were half in and half out when the
Professor sprang to his feet, his hands freed, the
frayed ends of the braid sash hanging. He
had John's dirk in his left hand; he had released
himself by rubbing up against it; in his right was
a small revolver.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">[Pg 248]</a></span></p>

<p>"Now I think we shall talk rather differently,"
he snarled. "You will drive me to the station,
young gentleman, and these young ladies will get
out to walk to Deeping Royal or Redlands&mdash;I
care not which."</p>

<p>The Professor was holding the revolver within
an inch of John's neck. Joey wondered whether
it was all a bad dream, or a reality in which she
ought to make a snatch at the revolver, and try
and overpower the Professor. But John settled
the question before she had time to decide.</p>

<p>"Get out, girls," he said. "You had better go
straight to Deeping Royal. I'll drive the Professor
along as he suggests."</p>

<p>Joey got out obediently, and the other two
followed suit.</p>

<p>"Hurry!" the Professor snarled.</p>

<p>John got his hands free of his coat in leisurely
fashion. The girls stood close together on the
road. "Let's go for him," whispered Noreen;
but Joey was looking at John.</p>

<p>John's thin brown face was perfectly impassive,
but his right eyelid lay dead upon his cheek.
Joey knew quite well that John, alone, and with
a very game leg, had nevertheless something up
his sleeve.</p>

<p>"Get on!" reiterated the Professor. His
French accent was dropping from him, Joey noticed;
he spoke good English now, though with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">[Pg 249]</a></span>
the hard guttural which hardly any Englishman
achieves.</p>

<p>The car was a self-starter. John whirled off
without remark, leaving the three Redlands girls
stranded rather forlornly on the wind-swept road.</p>

<p>They all three shivered a little as the car grew
smaller and smaller in the distance. They were
afraid for John, and also puzzled by his acquiescence
in the situation&mdash;an acquiescence so out of
keeping with the little bit of ribbon on his jacket.
Added to which they were all three very cold, and
a longish walk and drive lay between them and
tea.</p>

<p>Noreen broke the silence. "I vote we get on
to Deeping Royal, and tell Miss Conyngham
what has happened. Some story anyhow, if she
does row us for sloping off. Won't she be jolly
excited to know about the Professor? What do
you say, Gabrielle and Joey?"</p>

<p>"Yes, I think we had better go now," Gabrielle
agreed. "I'm afraid we can't do anything
for John, and Miss Conyngham ought to
know."</p>

<p>But Joey stood still stubbornly by the roadside.
"I don't care if she ought; I'm going to
wait for John," she said. "At least, I mean,
I'm going along to Mote to tell Cousin Greta
what's happened to him."</p>

<p>Joey tried to speak as though she did not mind<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">[Pg 250]</a></span>
a bit about the three-mile tramp, or anything.
"You two go along to the match, and tell Miss
Conyngham. I'll try and square up the disobedience
and being so untidy, and letting Redlands
down, afterwards, when there's time."</p>

<p>Joey thought she had never realised till then
what her two friends could be. Each seized an
arm.</p>

<p>"Slink back to the match, and leave you to be
in a row all by yourself? Likely, isn't it, you
juggins?" Noreen inquired scornfully. And
Gabrielle&mdash;Gabrielle, Head of the Lower
School, who had never been known to break a
rule since Joey had known her, added calmly:</p>

<p>"We'll all go to Mote, Joey; I think you are
right. Of course it is disobeying the Redlands
rule; but I will explain to Miss Conyngham why
we did it, afterwards. In any case we couldn't
leave you."</p>

<p>"I say, you are bricks!" Joey said rather
chokingly, and then the three set out together at
a run towards the turning to Mote. They had
passed it in the car, and were indeed now within
about half a mile of the Round Tower. Joey
found herself noticing, for all her anxiety about
John, how gaunt and sinister it looked, standing
up against the shivering sodden grass, and the
dreary wind-swept sky, in that minute before<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
she and the others turned their backs upon it,
and began to struggle towards Mote in the teeth
of a wind that seemed to have grown overwhelmingly
strong in the last few minutes.</p>

<p>Now that they faced towards the sea it was
truly terrific. Noreen and Gabrielle had their
close school hats jammed low upon their foreheads,
and even then it was almost impossible to
keep them on. Joey, being hatless, was not
affected by this difficulty; but her djibbah
flapped furiously about her, her hair was all over
the place, and she found it really difficult to keep
her footing. It was extraordinary how much the
gale had grown within the last twelve or fifteen
minutes.</p>

<p>But the three friends locked arms and fought
their way on determinedly. Joey meant to get
somehow to Mote, and let John's people know
what he was doing.</p>

<p>"And after that we shall probably meet the
school&mdash;going home," Gabrielle gasped out; "and
we can get ourselves picked up. They'll have to
come back; they can never play the match out
in this wind."</p>

<p>"I hope they come along soon; it's going to
pour by the look of the sky, and we haven't got
macs," Noreen said. "There! I felt a splash of
rain in my face already."</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">[Pg 252]</a></span></p>

<p>"So did I; but it wasn't rain, it tasted salt,"
panted Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"Spray couldn't come out here, could it?" asked
Joey. "We're a long way from the sea."</p>

<p>"About a mile," Noreen screamed in her ear.</p>

<p>"Oh, no, spray couldn't come out here, even
at the most extraordinarily high tide."</p>

<p>Another dash in their faces. "<em>That</em> came
from the river," said Gabrielle.</p>

<p>They had almost reached the low-arched
bridge that spans the river Mentle, about three-quarters
of a mile beyond the Round Tower.
The water was surging angrily against the
arches, and, at intervals of a minute or so, sending
up a great splash over the very low stone border
and into the road.</p>

<p>"Funny, because it can't be high tide yet,"
said Noreen. "I looked it up to see if there was
any chance of the Team getting splashed in
Fishmarket Field. It isn't till 3.40."</p>

<p>"Then it's going to be an extra specially high
one," remarked the experienced Gabrielle, looking
down at the surging, bankless Mentle.</p>

<p>"I should think they would get some healthy
splashes in the field; the spray comes right over
the old sea-wall in a really rough tide."</p>

<p>"Oh, never mind the old tide&mdash;let's get on to
Mote!" urged Joey.</p>

<p>And just as she said it, the thing happened.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">[Pg 253]</a></span></p>

<p>There was a sudden appalling roar&mdash;a long,
crashing roar. The river gave a sort of shuddering
sigh, and then, far off along its brimming
level, something seemed to rise up&mdash;a great grey
wall, foam-tipped. Joey stared at it, fascinated,
but not frightened.</p>

<p>But Gabrielle knew the fens. She grasped
Joey roughly by the arm, Gabrielle, who was always
so gentle in her ways.</p>

<p>"Come on! Run! Run back from the river,"
she screamed. "That's an Eigre!"</p>

<p>Joey hadn't a notion what an Eigre might be,
but there was urgency in Gabrielle's tone. They
all three turned and ran back along the road
that they had come. Only Joey looked over
her shoulder, and thought she never would forget
what she saw as long as she lived.</p>

<p>The wall of water, curling as it came, swept
nearer; then suddenly it broke with a noise like
thunder, and, with a great swirl and rush, the
water was over the bridge in a whirl, was spreading
far and wide, was about their feet.</p>

<p>"<em>Run!</em>" Gabrielle shouted again, as a second
great surge brought the water washing against
their knees. And run they did, through a world
that seemed all water, as far as the eye could
reach.</p>

<p>No one who was at Redlands then, least of all
those three friends, will ever forget that wild 31st<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">[Pg 254]</a></span>
of October, when the old sea-wall went down,
and the highest tide that men had known for
thirty years burst in upon the Deeps of Little
Holland!</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="21">XXI</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">In the Round Tower</small></h2>

<p>There are white posts set at intervals along
the fen roads to guide travellers in the dark.
A necessary precaution as the roads are often
ditch-bordered, and for half the year those
ditches brim.</p>

<p>The posts are barely two feet in height; by the
time the girls had reached the spot where John
had left them, only the tops of those posts were
left uncovered; the tide was plainly driving in
with terrific force, and wherever they looked
they saw nothing but the waste of tossing water.</p>

<p>Not one of the three would have owned to being
frightened, and it was in quite a cheerful
voice that Noreen put their worst danger into
words.</p>

<p>"Hurry up, you two. We must get somewhere
before the posts cover, or we shan't be able
to find the road."</p>

<p>Joey remembered the deep slanting ditches;
to slip into one of them had been a very real danger
on that foggy Sunday when she had come
back alone from Cousin Greta's; to do so now<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">[Pg 256]</a></span>
would be almost certain death. She did her best
to splash along faster, though she was beginning
to feel decidedly conscious that it was a long time
since breakfast, and that she was chilled to the
bone. It seemed as though the three of them
had been splashing through that cold swirly
water for years, and there didn't seem any particular
end to it; and what had happened to
John?</p>

<p>"Where are we going?" she asked dully. "The
Round Tower is nearest."</p>

<p>She had to look round, as she spoke, to make
sure that the tower was there. All the familiar
objects looked so different, standing in this vast
sea.</p>

<p>"Yes, it's nearest, but we won't go there,"
Gabrielle said, in her sensible way. "You see,
though it's uncomfortable and very cold to go
wading along like this, we are quite safe on the
road till the water is a good bit deeper. To try
and get across the Deeps with the floods out
would be almost as risky as it would have been
to try and cross the river just now when it was
pouring across the bridge. If we just keep
along quietly we shall come to the turning off to
Hesgate Church and Rectory, and we can get
shelter there till the tide goes down, or someone
comes for us."</p>

<p>Gabrielle's matter-of-fact tone had a very<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">[Pg 257]</a></span>
cheering effect. She was the smallest of the
three, but she was quite the Head of the Lower
School just then, and no one thought of disputing
her verdict.</p>

<p>"What do you think the others are doing?"
Joey asked anxiously. She had been afraid to
ask that question before, but Gabrielle seemed
so undisturbed by the ways of floods that she
felt things could not be as bad as they had
seemed.</p>

<p>"I think they will be quite all right," Gabrielle
said. "You see Deeping Royal is used to high
tides and things of that sort, and people always
take refuge in the churches there. The towers
were built frightfully strong on purpose. Miss
Conyngham once told us about a big flood, in
1830 it was, I think, and the people had to stay
in the twin towers all night, while the great
waves surged round. One man was so grateful
that he gave a new peal of bells to both towers,
and put a text on the biggest bell: 'The flood
arose, the stream beat vehemently upon that
house and could not shake it.'"</p>

<p>"I like that," Joey said.</p>

<p>"Yes, wasn't it decent, and he never gave his
name either; he was a stranger in Deeping
Royal, and he just sent the bells from London
when he had got away safely. The Vicar had
'The gift of a grateful heart,' carved below his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>
text on the bell, and they ring a peal every year
on the anniversary of the great flood in memory
of him. That day comes in the spring; we always
get high tides&mdash;special tides, you know&mdash;at
spring and autumn."</p>

<p>"Well, this one will have come to its highest
pretty soon, I expect," Joey said. "You've got
a watch, Gabrielle; what's the time?"</p>

<p>Gabrielle looked. "Five past three; and we're
just opposite the Round Tower; that means it
isn't much more than a mile to Hesgate Rectory.
We shall...."</p>

<p>What they might have done remained unknown.
There was a curious sound behind them,
nothing very loud, but loud enough to make
them look round. The water all around them
seemed to upheave violently. Instinctively they
clung together, and it was a mercy that they did.
There was a terrific suck and gurgle about them,
and next moment the white posts were all obliterated,
and they were swaying helplessly in a
great waste of water, which had suddenly grown
frighteningly deep. "What is it?" Joey gasped,
as the first shock passed, and they found themselves
still on their feet, but with the water washing
nearly to their waists.</p>

<p>"I don't know," Gabrielle said, staring around
her, but Noreen gave a little choke. "You bet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">[Pg 259]</a></span>
it's the reservoir&mdash;that weak bank gone&mdash;and it's
still forty minutes to high tide."</p>

<p>Joey woke up. "We must get across to the
Round Tower."</p>

<p>"It's locked, isn't it?" asked Noreen. It was
a proof she was inwardly frightened that she
did not add, "you juggins!"</p>

<p>"And there's a bad ditch somewhere near it,
Joey," Gabrielle added. "We could never find
it now."</p>

<p>"I could," Joey spoke confidently. "I've been
there, remember. Hold on to me, Gabby; I'm
sure I can dodge that ditch; I know where it
was."</p>

<p>Gabrielle hesitated for a moment; while Noreen
and Joey looked anxiously at her. Every
one knew that Gabrielle could not swim. Noreen
was not much of a performer; but Gabrielle
had been too delicate to learn at all so far.</p>

<p>"We might keep the road," she said; "but we
mightn't, and it's a mile. We'll risk the ditch&mdash;on
one condition, Joey. If we slip&mdash;and we'll
be going into deeper water anyhow, you know&mdash;you
and Noreen must save yourselves, and not
bother about me."</p>

<p>"We're not going to slip, but we're going to
hurry," Joey said. "I'll go in front, because I
know the way. You hold on to me, Gabby, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_260" id="Page_260">[Pg 260]</a></span>
Noreen hold on to you. We'll have to jump the
roadside ditch; it isn't a wide one, but it will
make a beastly splash. When I say Now!"</p>

<p>They turned sideways. "Now!" shrieked Joey.
They all jumped, and Noreen failed to clear the
ditch, and had to be pulled out, spluttering and
choking, by the other two.</p>

<p>They had landed in water that was more than
waist high, for the road was raised. The question
was how much more the fen dipped before
they reached the tower. Joey plunged on, but
cautiously, putting one foot well in advance of
the other, in terror of that yawning ditch. It
was all very well to say so confidently that she
remembered its exact position; how was one to
be sure of the exact position of anything with all
the world water, and a sense that at any moment
one might step clean out of one's depth? Joey
had swum well out of her depth on the last seaside
holiday the family had shared, but then
Father was beside her to call, "Steady! and don't
hurry your stroke"; and "Put your hand up on
my shoulder," when she was getting tired. Swimming
now would be a very different matter with
Noreen, who had only just achieved the width
of the Redlands swimming bath last summer,
and Gabrielle, who was helpless, to bring to
safety besides herself. All the same she never
thought for an instant that she might not be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">[Pg 261]</a></span>
able to do it; that sort of thought was not for
English people. One just must.</p>

<p>The tide was rushing in at a truly terrific pace,
but the three, gripping desperately to each other,
kept their footing and struggled on. And so,
after what seemed an eternity of nightmare
struggling through the deepening water, they
flung themselves against the wall of the Round
Tower at last.</p>

<p>"Hold on, Gabby; I have to find the door,"
Joey cried cheerfully. The worst was over now,
she thought; the tower floor was well raised, and
inside there was a ladder. She waded round to
the narrow ledge, scrambled up, and felt the
door.</p>

<p>It was bolted as before, and this time she had
no knife in her pocket. To be accurate she had
no pocket in her djibbah; when she had begun
this long queer day her handkerchief had been
up her sleeve. Now it was probably whirling
hither and thither about the Deeps.</p>

<p>Joey stooped a little, and put her mouth to
the chink. She must make the young man hear.</p>

<p>"I say, do let us in. We're outside your
door."</p>

<p>She had shouted at the top of her voice, and
she got an answer, though it was not the answer
she expected. It was a queer muffled cry, but it
was a word, and the word was "Help!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_262" id="Page_262">[Pg 262]</a></span></p>

<p>Joey looked down from her slippery stand upon
Noreen and Gabrielle. Gabrielle was shoulder
deep; she was clinging silently to the rough wall
of the tower, but there was nothing much to take
hold of. Joey must get the door open and go
to her help at once.</p>

<p>"Got a knife, either of you?" she jerked at
them.</p>

<p>"I have," called Noreen.</p>

<p>Joey did not dare tell them to move from their
precarious position. The water was washing
hard against the tower; Gabrielle at least could
be washed away from it quite easily if she loosened
her grip.</p>

<p>"Chuck it here!" she shouted, and prayed that
she might not muff the catch. Noreen fumbled
and threw. Joey, leaning a little away from
the door, with one hand clinging, caught the
knife as it flew across the water, and held it&mdash;safe!</p>

<p>She had it open in a second, and forced the
bolt a minute later. Kneeling in the doorway,
she undid her braid sash, meaning to fling it out
to Noreen and Gabrielle.</p>

<p>"Get hold; we're all right now."</p>

<p>And as she spoke she heard again that muffled
call for help from somewhere underneath. Then,
of course, she remembered her first visit, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">[Pg 263]</a></span>
the jumpy young man who had come up through
the trap-door.</p>

<p>The floor of the Round Tower was hardly
under water yet; but what was it like underneath?
That last call had been the choked effort
of someone who couldn't breathe.</p>

<p>Joey stood irresolute for one second&mdash;but only
one. The jumpy young man was probably a
German, since he and the Professor had been
signalling to one another; but when you were
English you couldn't leave even a Hun to die
when he had called for help. Father had risked
his life to bring in a wounded German who was
lying in agony in a shell-swept reach of No-Man's
Land. She would not even have hesitated
for that second, if it had not been for the thought
of Gabrielle and Noreen holding on precariously,
with the deepening water washing round them,
waiting for her help. In her heart she knew that
her friends would not want her to hesitate.</p>

<p>She darted across the floor to the corner where
the trap-door was, and then she saw what had
happened. The owner of the tower had been
right in considering it rather shaky, and none too
safe. A great stone had come down, and lay
upon the trap-door, making it quite impossible
to push up from below.</p>

<p>Joey flung herself upon the great stone. "All
right&mdash;I'll get it open," she shouted; but there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">[Pg 264]</a></span>
was no answer. That faint choked call was not
repeated.</p>

<p>She pushed at the stone with all her strength,
but it did not budge. She pushed again, with
a terrible nightmare feeling that Gabrielle, her
friend, could not keep her footing in the water,
and was drowning while she wasted time. She
took a deep breath, and pushed, with cracking
muscles, for the third time, and the stone rolled
over with a loud splash, and the trap was free.</p>

<p>"Can you push?" she shouted. When she had
seen him before the young man had come up a
ladder propped against the side, and pushed
the trap up from below. But now there was no
sound or answer. Joey thought of Gabrielle's
story of the man who had been drowned in the
room below the Round Tower in just such another
flood, and hunted desperately for something
she could catch at and pull the trap-door
up.</p>

<p>She found a ring at last, and tugged with all
her might. The trap raised, and water sluiced
down into the opening, water that was washing
in through the open door. The water from above
met the water from below with a great splash.
There was no other sound.</p>

<p>Joey peered down the wide trap. Two groping
hands and a dead white face with staring
eyes showing dimly through the darkness. Black<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">[Pg 265]</a></span>
water, of an unknown depth, washed to and
fro.</p>

<p>She flung herself face downwards on the edge,
and dropped her braid sash straight between
the groping hands. "Catch hold!"</p>

<p>The hands fumbled blindly, and then gripped.
There was a fierce tug on the impromptu rope.
Joey dug her toes into the floor, in the effort
to escape being pulled in.</p>

<p>"That's right, hold on, and get to the ladder,"
she shouted. "Make haste."</p>

<p>She looked at the side where the ladder had
been; it was gone! And the water below was
still a good long way below the level of the floor,
and the trickle washing in would not raise it
till too late for Gabrielle and Noreen.</p>

<p>Joey looked round desperately for something
to which she could secure one end of her sash.
At all costs she must hurry to the help of the
other two. But there was nothing at all, nothing
except the ladder on the farther side of the
tower, fixed to the wall; and to reach that would
require a sash of treble the length. No, there
was only one thing to be done, unless she meant
to abandon the young man to his fate&mdash;and one
couldn't let an enemy drown when one was a soldier's
daughter.</p>

<p>"It's all right. I'll pull you up; but please
keep quiet and don't jerk, or you'll drag me in,"<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">[Pg 266]</a></span>
she called down, trying to speak confidently.
"Don't start to come up till I say 'Now'!" she
added hastily, as a frantic jerk to the rope all
but had her through the trap.</p>

<p>She slithered back over the floor to the farthest
extent her sash would give her, and got behind
the stone that she had moved with so much difficulty.
Then she looped the end of her sash,
got a desperate grip, took a long breath, and
shrieked "Now!"</p>

<p>It was a frightful tug. Her straining body
pushed the heavy stone with it nearer and nearer
to the edge. Her hands seemed as though they
were being wrenched away from her wrists, and
her arms from her shoulders. The toes and her
knees scraped the stone of the floor as she dug
them in fiercely to gain hold, and she was
dragged forward all the time. It never occurred
to her to let go, but she knew vaguely that it was
only a question of seconds before she went
through the trap for all her efforts. And then
a hand caught the edge of the trap, and the
strain slackened suddenly.</p>

<p>Joey fell backwards, and lay there panting
and speechless for a second, while the young
man exhaustedly dragged himself up to safety.
But she only lay for one moment; then struggled
up and to the door.</p>

<p>Her heart was thumping with hammer<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">[Pg 267]</a></span>
strokes; she felt sure that she would not see her
friends. It seemed such years that she had been
wrestling with the trap-door, and trying to grip
on to that slippery sash.</p>

<p>But they were there; clinging tightly&mdash;Noreen
with her arm round Gabrielle, both with
their heads turned anxiously to the door. Noreen
spoke quite cheerfully, though with chattering
teeth.</p>

<p>"I say, buck up with that sash, you juggins!"
she grinned. "We're getting wet."</p>

<p>Joey didn't answer, because there was such
a lump in her throat that she couldn't. She
threw the pulled and ravelled sash, and Noreen
caught it. Steadying themselves with it and
the wall of the tower she and Gabrielle came
safely to the door, and scrambled up into the
tower.</p>

<p>Joey hugged them both, regardless of the
young man's presence. "Oh, you dears!"</p>

<p>"What made you such an age?" Noreen inquired.
"Did you stop to explore the tower or
something?"</p>

<p>The young man answered the question. "She
saved my life. I was suffocating there, and
drowning, and she pulled me up. I owe her
my life."</p>

<p>"Oh, that's all right," Joey said, rather flustered.
"Anyone would have lent a hand, of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">[Pg 268]</a></span>
course. But do you mind telling us now whether
you are in league with our Stinks Professor&mdash;you
signal to him, don't you? But I hope
you aren't doing beastly things like poisoning
water, for you don't seem that sort."</p>

<p>The jumpy young man stared at the three
Redlands girls, till his eyes seemed ready to start
from his head. Then he gasped, "How do you
know?"</p>

<p>"Because we've got the Professor&mdash;at least
I think John has&mdash;and anyhow we've spoilt his
game," Joey announced triumphantly. "But we
want to know if you've been doing those kind
of beastly spy things too&mdash;because we don't want
to be hateful, but we couldn't shake hands with
you and be friends if you have!"</p>

<p>They stood ankle-deep in the water, and stared
at one another, Joey and the man whose life
she had saved. There was a dead silence for a
whole minute; then he said:</p>

<p>"I have worked with him, and I knew something
of his plans, but <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">mon Dieu!</i> how I hated
them and him. For my home is in Alsace, and
my father and mother were French. The Professor,
who is no more French than you are, had
lent my father money, and I was to work it out
as his assistant. And since the War he has
forced me to work for him in this country, knowing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">[Pg 269]</a></span>
I was too much implicated to betray him.
And that is the truth, Mademoiselle."</p>

<p>Joey held out her hand. "You'll chuck it
now, of course, and I'm sure Colonel Sturt will
see about your not getting into trouble; and, if
you don't mind, I could speak to Mademoiselle
de Lavernais about you&mdash;she comes from Alsace
too. We're no end glad you're all right, really."</p>

<p>"Rather!" said Noreen and Gabrielle with
great heartiness, and all three shook hands with
the Alsatian solemnly.</p>

<p>"What's your name?" asked Joey, feeling that
she ought to act as mistress of the ceremonies in
right of her former acquaintance with the
jumpy young man.</p>

<p>"I was baptized 'Hans'; when the doors and
windows were all shut my parents called me
'Jean,' 'Jean Corvette,'" he said.</p>

<p>"Righto, we'll call you that," Joey said. "I
thought you couldn't be a Hunnish kind of German
when you were so decent to me that Sunday,
you know. We'll introduce ourselves, and
then it will all be as right as rain. This is
Gabrielle Arden, and here's Noreen O'Hara,
and I'm Joey Graham."</p>

<p>Two drowned rats bowed politely in acknowledgment
of Joey's introduction; but the jumpy
young man was not looking at them. He was
staring at Joey.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">[Pg 270]</a></span></p>

<p>"Graham&mdash;Graham&mdash;" he muttered; then
suddenly: "I was with the gardeners that night
you act in the big hall, and you have the look
of him then, Mademoiselle. Was your father
a major of the name of Graham?"</p>

<p>"Yes, he was; but the Huns killed him with
their beastliness to him when he was wounded
and a prisoner," Joey said.</p>

<p>"You saved my life; I will tell you all I
know," the young man said. "When the Professor
sent for me to come here, two months
ago, Major Graham was <em>not</em> dead, but alive and
working in the salt mines at Kochnecht."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" Joey gasped. "He was reported
killed."</p>

<p>"Many are reported so, but not all are dead.
Some day perhaps a search will find Englishmen
left behind in Germany. Your Major Graham
is one&mdash;I gave him water when he was wounded,
and no woman would have pity, and he thanked
me and said I was 'a good chap,' and smiled as
you smile, Mademoiselle, so I remember him.
But the Count that used to shoot at Calgarloch
Castle had a spite against your father, and returned
him 'killed.'"</p>

<p>The tower room swam with Joey for a moment;
she felt sick and queer.</p>

<p>"I say, you're not going to faint or anything<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">[Pg 271]</a></span>
rotten like that, are you?" cried Noreen; "because
it's a beastly damp place to do it in."</p>

<p>"Don't, Noreen, it's her pater." That was
Gabrielle speaking. Joey pulled herself together.</p>

<p>"I'm all right&mdash;only it's ... it's so heavenly.
<em>Did</em> you hear, Father's <em>alive</em>!"</p>

<p>Noreen seized her round the waist. "Yes, I
heard, and it wasn't heartlessness, only you did
look funny for a minute. Joey, I <em>am</em> glad; and
isn't it queer and topping that everything's gone
and happened like this. If there had been no
flood, or John had driven us to Deeping Royal
as he intended, we should have been up the twin
towers with the rest, and you would never have
heard this."</p>

<p>"And if I hadn't been caught in the sea-roke
that Sunday, and known you were down the
trap-door, I shouldn't have known where to look
for you when you called 'Help!'" Joey said
to Jean Corvette.</p>

<p>"And if you had not risked your life to rescue
me, Mademoiselle Joey, I should never have
talked again," he said.</p>

<p>"And if we hadn't been Joey's special friends
and waited for her at the reservoir, I suppose
the old Professor would have got away, and most
of this wouldn't have happened," Gabrielle suggested
seriously. "We're all very wet, and Matron<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">[Pg 272]</a></span>
<em>will</em> be cross to-morrow; but it's all been
gloriously worth while."</p>

<p>"Hasn't it just!" Joey cried ecstatically.
"And now, if Jean doesn't mind, let's get up
that ladder. You bet John will be looking out
for us as soon as he has settled the Professor,
and I know he had some plan when he said he
would drive him."</p>

<p>Jean made no objection, though he was still
too much exhausted to go with them. But the
three friends, undeterred by wet and clinging
garments, climbed the shaky ladders to what
was left of the top floor of the tower, where they
found the electric torch which Jean must have
used lying close under a loop-hole window.</p>

<p>"Of course a torch-flash isn't easy to read in
daylight, but there's no sun, and it's getting
darker," Joey suggested.</p>

<p>"Then it must be past high tide," Noreen said
joyfully. The three stood at the loop-hole, looking
out for a minute in silence over the dreary
grey waste of water. A wicker hen-coop and
a large bath-tub washed aimlessly about near the
walls of their refuge, farther off a poor drowned
sheep showed, half submerged.</p>

<p>Gabrielle put her arm through Joey's. "We
might have been drowned too," she said, "and instead
we're all right, and your father's alive."</p>

<p>Joey couldn't answer that for a second: then<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">[Pg 273]</a></span>
she said huskily, "Thanks awfully, and I <em>am</em>
glad we're all in it together."</p>

<p>"And always will be for ever and ever,
Amen," chipped in Noreen the irrepressible.
"Gabrielle will be Upper School next term, Miss
Craigie thinks, but she'll never desert the alliance,
I know. It's going to be for always."</p>

<p>"I say, I am jolly glad I came to Redlands,"
Joey said from her heart.</p>

<p>They took turns after that to work the torch,
sending S.O.S. signals out into the wet world,
while the tide steadily sucked back and back,
leaving the tops of the white posts uncovered
once more. And then over the grey waste a boat
came, and they tore down the ladders at a breakneck
pace to welcome John, rowed by a sturdy
policeman.</p>

<p>"What's happened to him&mdash;the Professor?"
shrieked Noreen, as soon as the boat came into
hailing distance.</p>

<p>"Oh, you're all right, you three, thank goodness!"
John sent back, as he steered the boat
carefully for the tower door. "I felt rather
jumpy about you, when the sea burst in. But I
might have known Joey would come out top.
The Professor?&mdash;oh, he is safely in the lock-up,
with his violet handkerchief&mdash;which it seems is
the secret insignia of his crowd&mdash;and his precious
bugs. The flood was really a convenience, otherwise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">[Pg 274]</a></span>
I meant to run my car into a ditch, and
have him that way if poss. As it was, the tide
burst in and swamped us, and he can't swim and
was in a blue funk of drowning, so I had no
bother at all. Just left him hanging on to the
car, without his bugs, revolver, or hanky, and
swam for help. I could have waded, of course,
but swimming was easier for my game leg, and
more impressive. And they're all right at Deeping
Royal; they're sending boats. So you have
nothing to do, but to let us get you back to Redlands."</p>

<p>Hanging on to the door, Joey stooped to whisper
to John. "John, be nice to this man here,
because he's told me Father is alive in Germany."</p>

<p>"What, your pater alive after all! Top-hole!"
John said. "That <em>will</em> be something to tell Aunt
Greta!"</p>

<p>Joey looked back at the Round Tower, as
she and the rest were rowed quickly away from
it. How little she had guessed, when she had
first come to Redlands, and looked at it with so
much interest, what it would mean to her!</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>That night, while a disapproving Matron,
armed with an immense bottle of sal volatile,
stood by, urging bed for everyone, Joey Graham
was cheered at tea by the entire school.</p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2>CHAPTER <abbr title="22">XXII</abbr><br />
<small class="small-caps">The Great Election</small></h2>

<p>It was wonderfully quiet in the Queen's Hall,
considering that six hundred girls were assembled
there. Of course, there was not the absolute
pin-drop silence of the times when Miss
Conyngham read prayers, but that was not to
be expected because The Election&mdash;(it was always
<em>the</em> Election at Redlands)&mdash;was in progress.
For the last hour there had been a steady
tramp of feet going to and returning from the
platform on which there sat in silent dignity the
"Heads of the Upper and Lower School."</p>

<p>Before each was a large waste-paper basket,
and into one or other of those receptacles each
girl dropped a folded paper containing the name
of a candidate for the highest dignity the school
could offer.</p>

<p>The Head of the Upper School must be
chosen from the Upper or the Lower Sixth;
the Head of the Lower from Remove II. A or B,
that was the one restriction. It gave a choice
of forty girls in the Upper School and of sixty
in the Lower. Every College girl had the right<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">[Pg 276]</a></span>
to vote, with the exception of the retiring dignitaries;
even Tiddles had her buff slip, and was
laboriously printing something on it with a much-sucked
pencil. No Redlands girl would have
forgone the privilege of voting for the world.</p>

<p>Six weeks had gone by since that exciting 31st
of October; six wonderful weeks for Joey.
Weeks when extraordinary things happened;
among others a day in town with Colonel Sturt
(who wasn't gruff at all) and with Cousin Greta,
when she was taken to the War Office to answer
the keen, interested questions of a couple of
splendid-looking staff officers, who were very
kind to her, and promised that the business of
searching for her father should be put in hand
without a second's delay. They shook hands
with Joey, and congratulated her when they had
finished. She went to lunch at the Ritz afterwards,
feeling deliriously happy, and much older.
The only bar to her perfect bliss was the
fact that she might not tell Mums about that
wonderful hope forthwith. Cousin Greta said
it would be cruel, until the hope was a certainty,
and Cousin Greta had been so wonderfully kind
and understanding of late that Joey felt sure she
must be right. Still not even the lovely little
gold wrist-watch bracelet which her cousin chose
for her in Bond Street, when lunch was over,
could make up for having to keep silence to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">[Pg 277]</a></span>
Mums. It was a better consolation when Lady
Greta said she was going to ask Mums down for
the "Old Girls' Day" at the end of the term,
so that Joey could show her the school and her
friends, and they could travel back to Scotland
together. Joey thought it would be a particularly
pleasant thing to show the school to Mums
just now, when everyone was being so extraordinarily
nice to her. Even Ingrid Latimer
and her friend Joan Chichester, that big Sixth
Former who had put Joey on the table the day
that she and Gabby and Noreen were going to
meet Miss Craigie, condescended to a good deal
of notice. Joey felt her cup of pride would
brim over if she could bring Mums up to these
majestic people and say, carelessly, "I'd like you
to know my mother," as she had heard Joan
Chichester do when her people came down at
Mid-term. Of course, in old days it would have
been unheard-of cheek for any member of the
Lower School, except for Gabrielle, who breakfasted
with Miss Conyngham when school matters
needed attention, and could say, "I say,
Ingrid, oughtn't we...."</p>

<p>It was that "we" which was so wonderful,
really; much more so than breakfasting with
the Head!</p>

<p>Still, for all she was a mere Remover II. B
girl, Ingrid had been most uncommonly gracious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">[Pg 278]</a></span>
since the flood; Joey thought that one might
perhaps risk an introduction, and thanked Cousin
Greta warmly.</p>

<p>Cousin Greta patted her hand. "And I hope
you will have a little welcome to spare for your
old cousin too, my dear; for I want to come too,
and to bring Gracie as well as John."</p>

<p>"Oh, are you coming? How topping!" Joey
cried, and the remark was quite truthful as far
as Cousin Greta and John were concerned,
though Joey wasn't quite sure how she felt about
Gracie. And then Cousin Greta said something
so astounding that it took her breath away.</p>

<p>"Joey, I want you to be kind to Gracie and
show her round the school, because&mdash;she is coming
to Redlands as a weekly boarder next term."</p>

<p>"<em>What?</em>" Joey had jerked out, forgetting
manners. Gracie at Redlands, being talked to
candidly by people like Noreen and Syb and
Barbara! It was hard to picture.</p>

<p>"Yes, she is coming," Cousin Greta repeated,
with a smile. "Her father and I both think
that Redlands will be good for Gracie. You
are not such a bad specimen of a Redlands girl,
you know."</p>

<p>"You should see Ingrid&mdash;wish she weren't
leaving," Joey told her, with conviction; "and
Noreen and Gabrielle. Now they <em>are</em> toppers."</p>

<p>Lady Greta smiled, and said she would take<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span>
Joey's word for it; but Joey must bring any
of her special friends that she liked with her
to Mote, subject, of course, to Miss Conyngham's
permission. Altogether life had been extraordinarily
pleasant during the last six weeks.</p>

<p>Jean Corvette was to go back to the home
which was not any longer under the German
heel. Joey's faith in Colonel Sturt's power "to
put it right" for the poor fellow had been justified.
She never knew what Colonel Sturt said
to the police and the War Office, or they to
him; but the fact remained that Jean's unwilling
share in the Professor's plots and plans was
all condoned, and he was to go back to Alsace
with Mademoiselle de Lavernais at the end of
the term.</p>

<p>Mademoiselle's departure was an open secret
by the time that was settled, and most of the
girls were sorry, in spite of their not infrequent
grumbles at her strictness. It was Joey who
suggested to Gabrielle the idea of a farewell offering
from the Lower School, but the whole
of the Lower School jumped at it, and also at
Joey's further plan of learning the "Marseillaise"
properly in French, so that "Maddy" should
realise the alliance between France and England
was a reality even where schoolgirls were
concerned. All Remove II. B contributed a
shilling per girl&mdash;not bad when the end of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
term and Christmas were near&mdash;the junior forms
sixpence, and the kindergarten babies threepence.
The result was a highly respectable sum,
which was entrusted to the hands of Gabrielle,
who went to Lincoln with Miss Craigie and
bought a beautiful leather dispatch case, fitted
with every luxury. And Clare, shuddering occasionally,
but very valiant on the whole,
drummed the difficult tune and time of the "Marseillaise"
into the most unmusical members of
the Lower School; it being a point of honour
that everyone should sing.</p>

<p>The presentation to Maddy was to take place
after voting; Miss Craigie, taken into confidence,
had promised to arrange that Maddy should
be in the kindergarten playroom, even if she had
to drag her there, directly the election was over.
The "counting" only concerned the retiring officers,
Ingrid and Gabrielle, out of all the girls,
and Gabrielle had delegated to Joey her position
of spokesman and presenter of the dispatch case
and list of subscribers. There would be no time
if they waited till after dinner, she said; the "Old
Girls" who always came to the Christmas Breaking-Up
would surround Maddy, and leave no
one else a chance to speak to her.</p>

<p>So the Lower School, with the exception of
its Head, surged towards the kindergarten playroom,
as soon as they left Queen's Hall, Joey<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span>
only pausing to seize the dispatch case, with the
enormous list of names in all hand-writings tied
to its handle and fluttering out from it like a
great black and white banner, and to bring it
along with her.</p>

<p>Miss Craigie had kept her promise faithfully.
"Maddy" was there in the kindergarten with her,
rusty as to front, and shabby as to dress as
ever, but somehow younger, Joey thought, than
she had been on that dreadful day when Joey
asked her to "amuse" the class with stories of
the Franco-Prussian War.</p>

<p>Maddy looked round, surprised, as the Lower
School poured in, and made a hasty movement
towards the farther door. Maddy was known
to loathe a noise! But Miss Craigie held her
arm firmly and gave her no opportunity of flight.
The Lower School fell into an immense horseshoe,
in treble rows, the little ones in front, then
the next size, then the tallest. Maddy and Miss
Craigie were left inside.</p>

<p>Clare scuffled to the piano, and struck a chord,
and the Lower School crashed joyfully into the
"Marseillaise," all singing at the tops of their
voices. Maddy bore it, though some of the pronunciation
was, to say the least of it, eccentric,
and Rhoda Watson, who had about as much
music in her as a cow, was shrieking into her left
ear half a tone flat throughout.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">[Pg 282]</a></span></p>

<p>Joey advanced the moment that the music
stopped. "Please, Mademoiselle, we learnt that
for you," she said, "to show we're your friends,
if you'll have us, just as France and England
are friends, for ever and ever. We're frightfully
sorry you're going away, and will you please accept
this dispatch case, with a lot of love from
the Lower School?"</p>

<p>"That's the list of us," she added hastily, as
the huge paper nearly obscured the dispatch
case altogether. "I'm sorry it's such an outsize,
but you see some of the kids write so large,
and we all wanted to sign."</p>

<p>Mademoiselle de Lavernais took the dispatch
case from Joey. There was a queer look in her
tired black eyes for a moment. "Thank you,
Joey, I would not have the paper smaller," she
said.</p>

<p>She stood quite silent for a moment; then
began to speak in her level voice that had hardly
a hint of foreign pronunciation about it.</p>

<p>"To say thank you is a little thing, to feel
thanks warmly through you is a bigger. I carry
that warmth with me for the rest of my life&mdash;and
there was a time when I was not only glad
because I was going back to my own country,
but because I was leaving Redlands. Now that
is not so. I leave Redlands with regret, but I
shall carry in my heart the memory of it, and of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">[Pg 283]</a></span>
you all. And that is something to bring back
with me to a home from which a little girl, as
young as Tiddles, was driven more than fifty
years ago. Now that I am so near going back,
I dare again allow myself to see the picture of
the burning <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ch&acirc;teau</span>, the flames rising behind
the trees, and my nursery a blackened shell, as
the front wall fell forward. I see my cot against
the wall, my doll's house, black with flaming
edge ... myself crying pitifully, but at the
same time thankful to my father who permitted
me to bury my cherished dolls in the hole he
had dug to preserve our heirlooms from the
conquering German. My father himself fired
the <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ch&acirc;teau</span> that no German should pollute it,
and went out homeless into the wide world, deserting
all, sooner than live under German rule.
I kissed my little hands to my beloved dolls,
down in the garden mould, whispering, with the
faith of childhood, that I would soon come back
and dig them up again. And after one-and-fifty
years I keep that promise. I go back alone, the
last of all my family, to the home of my childhood;
but I shall not be lonely in that I take
with me the love of the Lower School."</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>After that came dinner, a hasty and somewhat
noisy affair, when mistresses made no particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>
effort to keep order, and no one talked of anything
but the Election.</p>

<p>Ingrid and Gabrielle came in rather late;
Joey tried to catch Gabrielle's eye and show
her there was room to squeeze in between herself
and Noreen; but Gabrielle, looking flushed
and excited, only smiled at her in answer to the
invitation, and sat down at the far end of the
table. And after dinner there was the scramble
to dress, to the tune of rumbling wheels and
snorting cars, as the old girls and the more ordinary
visitors poured up in an unending stream.</p>

<p>Then the prize-giving&mdash;one side of the Queen's
Hall entirely filled with excited girls in best
frocks, the other with visitors of all ages; old
girls conspicuous among them by their proprietary
air.</p>

<p>The school list read, as it would stand with
the beginning of the new term, going from the
babies in the kindergarten up to the high and
mighty Sixth. Noreen and Joey in Remove II.
A. Gabrielle in the Upper School, the youngest
girl there by a whole year. Barbara heading
Remove II. B. Syb second. The prospects for
the next term were great indeed, with the junior
hockey team colours for Joey and Noreen, to
add to all the rest.</p>

<p>Then the prize-giving&mdash;an armful to Gabrielle,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
but Remove II. B Maths. for Joey, and composition
to Noreen. They grudged nobody else anything
in the world after that, and Joey wanted
nothing but that her people should be there.
Cousin Greta had 'phoned that Mums had business
in town last night, and would not come to
Mote till to-day; but Joey had never thought
she would be late for the prize-giving. Still she
couldn't see the door from where she sat; Mums
and Cousin Greta and John and Gracie might
be standing among the group there who had
come in late, and would not disturb the performance
by moving about to find seats.</p>

<p>Prize-giving on Old Girls' Day always concluded
with the singing of Newbolt's stirring
verses, "The Best School of All," sung only
by collegers, past and present, standing. After
that would come the great announcement&mdash;the
result of the Election for the coming year.</p>

<p>As the first bars were played there was a stir
and a movement among the audience. In little
groups&mdash;in single state&mdash;people were standing
up. The years had rolled away from these; they
were Redlanders again each one of them, from
shy Jean Hyde, who had only left last term, to
old Lady Rownham, quite blind and bent with
rheumatism, but who would never dream of forgetting
that she had been a Redlands girl seventy
years ago.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">[Pg 286]</a></span></p>

<p>Visitors sat to listen to the great school song;
old girls stood to sing with the school, and for
five blissful minutes forgot everything&mdash;except
that they were back at Redlands, and Redlands
was theirs, and they were Redlands' still.</p>

<p>Newbolt's splendid words rang out to their
slow, grave marching tune.</p>

<p>Lady Rownham was singing with all her
might, and a pathetic effort to hold her slight
stooping shoulders back; she had been Vicereine
of India forty years ago, but, excepting for that
time, there had been few years in which she had
missed coming to the Old Girls' Day&mdash;and no
time when she had not been at Redlands in spirit.
They had sung rather cramped mid-Victorian
words as the school song for many of those
yearly festivals that she had known; but in these
very "Old Girls" had beat the heart of the school
none the less, though that earlier poet had lacked
the greatness of expression.</p>

<p>The last line swung out with triumphant fervour;
the old girls sat down. Miss Conyngham
stood forward; on her right were the two retiring
officers, Ingrid and Gabrielle, one very tall, the
other small and childish looking. Amid an absolute
silence from the assembled visitors Miss
Conyngham shook hands with each girl in turn.
"We all thank you for what you have done for
the school throughout the year," she said.</p>

<p>At Redlands it was always the youngest girl
at the school who called the cheers. A huge
Sixth Former had Tiddles ready beside the platform<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>
and hoisted her on to it at the right
moment. The mite faced the audience unblinkingly,
"Tree cheers for Ingrid Latimer! Tree
cheers for Gabrielle Arden!" she said in her tiny
distinct voice. It did not reach half the length
of the hall, but everyone who had been at a
"Redlands speecher" knew what was meant by
the appearance on the platform of the youngest
girl, and the cheers rang out with a will. Ingrid
and Gabrielle acknowledged them with a grave
bow, and then turned and walked off the platform
and down to their respective places in the
hall, leaving only the youngest girl in the school
to stand by Miss Conyngham's side.</p>

<p>A sealed envelope lay before the Head upon
the table. She took it up in her long slim fingers.</p>

<p>"I have now to announce the result of the Election,"
she said, speaking slowly and clearly, so
that her voice reached every corner of the great
hall. "I do not need to remind our old girls
what that election means to Redlands; it is the
visible expression of perfect trust; it means that
in the girl chosen to govern the Upper or the
Lower School the other girls feel they have someone
in whose hands can be safely placed the
honour of the school. It is a great trust and a
great privilege: the heads of the Upper and
Lower School are my right hand, and in their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
choice I have never found the school's judgment
in fault. The great Election took place this
morning; the results were checked by the retiring
officers and two mistresses, and the successful
names handed to me in this envelope, which
I now propose to unseal before you all."</p>

<p>She ripped it open and spread out the paper
it contained.</p>

<p>A pin could have been heard to drop as she
gave out the result of the Election.</p>

<p>"Head of the Upper School&mdash;<em>Joan Chichester</em>.
Head of the Lower School&mdash;<em>Jocelyn Graham</em>."</p>

<p>Joey sitting fizzling with excitement between
Noreen and Barbara nearly fell off her form in
sheer unbelieving amazement.</p>

<p>"What! it's not me that's it," she whispered
frantically, with a lack of grammar that would
have horrified Mr. Craigie away at Calgarloch.
Noreen gave her a friendly push. "You're not
deaf are you, you juggins. Of course it's you.
I thought it might be and I'm jolly glad. I
voted for you anyway, and so did Syb and Barbara."</p>

<p>Joey feverishly squeezed a hand of both her
neighbours. "You are dears!" she said unsteadily.</p>

<p>Ingrid looked round, the Head of the Upper
School still, for all she had resigned her dignities.
"No talking there!"</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>"The newly elected officers will come on to
the platform," said Miss Conyngham.</p>

<p>Joey arrived on the platform, still feeling
rather giddy, and as though she must be someone
else, and Miss Conyngham pinned to her
frock the little gold star brooch that was her
badge of office, and then shook hands.</p>

<p>"I congratulate you, Jocelyn. I think the
honour is well earned; I know it will be treated
faithfully."</p>

<p>She turned from Joey to Joan Chichester,
and invested her. Joey ought to have been
standing at attention by that enormous and distinguished
personage, whom it was so astounding
to think about as the colleague to whom in
the future one would say "we." But she was
not doing what she ought. From the platform
she could see the group by the door, and what
she saw put everything else out of her head for
the minute&mdash;even this wonderful new dignity.</p>

<p>Cousin Greta was there, with Colonel Sturt
and Gracie, the latter looking far less superior;
and John, jolly and cheery as ever, and leaning
on one crutch only instead of two. And beside
them Mums, and a tall khaki figure, worn and
thin and hollow-eyed; but unmistakable&mdash;<em>Father!</em></p>

<p>Their eyes met; it was only by a supreme effort<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span>
that Joey forced herself to stand still on
the platform and listen to the wonderful things
that Miss Conyngham was saying about her.</p>

<p>"To Collegers past and present the election
of the Heads of the Upper and Lower School
is of supreme importance," she said. "The
splendid record of Joan Chichester is well known
to us all; we have no doubt as to her fitness for
the honour accorded her by Redlands. Jocelyn
Graham is a new girl this term, and never before
in the history of Redlands has this honour been
conferred on a new girl. I am glad that Redlands
has broken its tradition in that respect.
A great opportunity came to Jocelyn Graham
six weeks ago&mdash;and she showed herself able to
meet it. We are proud of her at Redlands, and
believe that in her lives the spirit that has always
actuated the Heads of the Upper and
Lower School&mdash;the spirit which has set our
school where it is: a name to be honoured wherever
in the world a Redlands girl is found."</p>

<p>The big Sixth Former did not need to touch
little Tiddles on this occasion; she was ready.</p>

<p>"Tree cheers for the new Heads of the Upper
and Lower School!"</p>

<p>They finished at last, though Noreen, the experienced,
declared that there never had been
such cheering at Redlands, and Joey could dive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">[Pg 292]</a></span>
through the throng, moving teawards, to her
people.</p>

<p>Father had come to town last night, and
Mums, to whom the wonderful news that Jean
Corvette's Major Graham was the right one,
had been wired as soon as it was a certainty,
and who had met him there. They hadn't wired to
Joey, because Mums, who knew what was going
to happen on that last day, thought the excitement
would be upsetting, and she had better
know nothing till Father was there.</p>

<p>"Though it was a shame, when it all came
about through you, Joey," Mums said.</p>

<p>"Isn't it funny?" Joey remarked blissfully.
"It's like the house that Jack built&mdash;all going
back and back. If I hadn't wanted the scholarship
I wouldn't have come to Redlands, and
if Miss Craigie hadn't had 'flu,' I should have
travelled with her, and Noreen wouldn't have
ragged me about the Lab, and I shouldn't
have found out about the violet handkerchief,
and if Gracie had been like she is now, John
wouldn't have taught me signalling, and I
shouldn't have come back alone, and if Noreen
and Gabrielle hadn't been such bricks and waited
for me at the reservoir...."</p>

<p>"Yes," interrupted Father, "and if my eldest
daughter hadn't been out to keep her promise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
like an Englishman and take care of Mums,
I suppose she wouldn't have fagged for the
scholarship, and then there would have been no
beginning, middle,&mdash;or very glorious end."</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
